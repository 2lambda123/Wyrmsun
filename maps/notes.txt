When (re-)generating geodata-based maps, some manual touch-ups are required. In particular, trade route terrain features have to be modified so to remove superfluous tiles that harm their path-like look.

Additionally, for the Earth map the following water areas need to be touched up so that there is enough space for a ship to pass through:

1. The Sound.
2. The Dardanelles.
3. The Bosphorus.
4. The Strait of Sicily.
5. The Strait of Gibraltar.
