When (re-)generating geodata-based maps, some manual touch-ups are required. In particular, trade route terrain features have to be modified so to remove superfluous tiles that harm their path-like look.

Additionally, for the Earth map the Sound needs to be touched up so that there is enough space for a ship to pass through.
