He married a brave warrior-maiden, but after nine winters she grew bored of their life in Ulfdalir and fled, leaving the ring she had made for her, some of his finest work. While Volund fruitlessly searched for his missing wife, a group of warriors raided his dwelling under orders of the king of Lintanir. They took many of the products of Volund's craftsmanship, including his wife's ring. When the elven prince returned home, he was ambushed by the Lintanir warriors, and brought in chains to their king."

But the queen of Lintanir was unimpressed. Whatever gold Volund's father would pay could scarcely compare with enjoying the fruits of Volund's labor, she thought. And so she imprisoned Volund in the island of Saevarstad, where he would craft many wondrous treasures for the royal couple..."
