				"~<Atlakvitha En Grönlenzka~>\n\n~<The Greenland Lay of Atli~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThere are two Atli poems in the ~<Codex Regius~>, the ~<Atlakvitha~> (Lay of Atli) and the ~<Atlamol~> (Ballad of Atli). The poems are not preserved or quoted in any other old manuscript, but they were extensively used by the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~>. In the manuscript superscription to each of these poems appears the word \"Greenland,\" which has given rise to a large amount of argument. The scribe was by no means infallible, and in this case his statement proves no more than that in the period round 1300 there was a tradition that these two poems originated in the Greenland settlement.\n\nThe two Atli poems deal with substantially the same material: the visit of the sons of Gjuki to Atli's court, their deaths, and the subsequent revenge of their sister, Guthrun, Atli's wife, on her husband. The shorter of the two, the ~<Atlakvitha~>, tells the story with little elaboration; the ~<Atlamol~>, with about the same narrative basis, adds many details, some of them apparently of the poet's invention, and with a romantic, not to say sentimental, quality quite lacking in the ~<Atlakvitha~>. Both poems are sharply distinguished from the rest of the collection by their metrical form, which is the Malahattr (used irregularly also in the ~<Harbarthsljoth~>), employed consistently and smoothly in the ~<Atlamol~>, and with a considerable mixture of what appear to be Fornyrthislag lines (cf. Introduction) in the ~<Atlakvitha~>.\n\nIt is altogether probable that both poems belong to the eleventh century, the shorter ~<Atlakvitha~> being generally dated from the first quarter thereof, and the longer ~<Atlamol~> some fifty years or more later. In each case the poet was apparently a Christian; in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 82) Guthrun expresses her readiness to die and \"go into another light,\" and in the ~<Atlakvitha~> there is frequent use of mythological names (~<e.g.~>, Valhall, Hlithskjolf) with an evident lack of understanding of their relation to the older gods. These facts fit the theory of a Greenland origin exceedingly well, for the Greenland settlement grew rapidly after the first explorations of Eirik the Red, which were in 982-985, and its most flourishing period was in the eleventh century. The internal evidence, particularly in the case of the ~<Atlamol~>, points",

				"likewise to an origin remote from Iceland, Norway, and the \"Western Isles\"; and the two poems are sufficiently alike so that, despite the efforts of Finnur Jonsson and others to separate them, assigning one to Greenland and the other to Norway or else where, it seems probable that the manuscript statement is correct in both instances, and that the two Atli poems did actually originate in Greenland. An interesting account of this Greenland settlement is given in William Hovgaard's ~<Voyages of the Norsemen to America~>, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1914, and an extraordinarily vivid picture of the sufferings of the early settlers appears in Maurice Hewlett's ~<Thorgils~>, taken from the ~<Floamannasaga~>.\n\nFrom the standpoint of narrative material there is little that is distinctively Norse in either the ~<Atlakvitha~> or the ~<Atlamol~>. The story is the one outlined in the prose ~<Drap Niflunga~> (largely based on these two poems), representing almost exclusively the southern blending of the Attila and Burgundian legends (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>). In the ~<Atlakvitha~>, indeed, the word \"Burgundians\" is actually used. Brynhild is not mentioned in either poem; Sigurth's name appears but once, in the ~<Atlamol~>. Thus the material goes directly back to its South-Germanic origins, with little of the Northern making-over which resulted in such extensive changes in most parts of the Sigurth story. The general atmosphere, on the other hand, particularly in the ~<Atlamol~>, is essentially Norse.\n\nAs has been said, the ~<Atlakvitha~> is metrically in a chaotic state, the normal Malahattr lines being frequently interspersed with lines and even stanzas which apparently are of the older Fornyrthislag type. How much of this confusion is due to faulty transmission is uncertain, but it has been suggested that the composer of the ~<Atlakvitha~> made over in Malahattr an older Atli poem in ~<Fornyrthislag~>, and this suggestion has much to recommend it. That he worked on the basis of an older poem is, indeed, almost certain, for in oral prose tradition a far larger number of distinctively Norse traits would unquestionably have crept in than are found in the material of the ~<Atlakvitha~>. As for the ~<Atlamol~>, here again the poet seems to have used an older poem as his basis, possibly the ~<Atlakvitha~> itself, although in that case he must have had other material as well, for there are frequent divergences in such matters as proper names. The translation of the ~<Atlakvitha~> is rendered peculiarly difficult ",

				"by the irregularity of the metre, by the evident faultiness of the transmission, and above all by the exceptionally large number of words found nowhere else in Old Norse, involving much guesswork as to their meanings. The notes do not attempt to indicate all the varying suggestions made by editors and commentators as to the reconstruction of defective stanzas and the probable meanings of obscure passages; in cases which are purely or largely guesswork the notes merely point out the uncertainty without cataloguing the proposed solutions.\n\n__________________\n\nGuthrun, Gjuki's daughter, avenged her brothers, as has become well known. She slew first Atli's sons, and thereafter she slew Atli, and burned the hall with his whole company. Concerning this was the following poem made:\n\n1. Atli sent | of old to Gunnar\nA keen-witted rider, | Knefröth did men call him;\nTo Gjuki's home came he | and to Gunnar's dwelling,\nWith benches round the hearth, | and to the beer so sweet.\n\n[~<Prose~>. On the marriage of Guthrun to Atli at the instigation of her brothers, Gunnar and Hogni, and on the slaying of Atli and his two sons, Erp and Eitil, cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~> and note.\n\n1. Line 1 apparently is in Fornyrthislag. ~<Knefröth~> (the name is spelt in various ways, and its meaning is uncertain): in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) there are two messengers, one named Vingi and the other unnamed; the annotator combines the two versions in the ~<Drap Niflunga~>. ~<Benches~>, etc.: the adjective rendered \"round the hearth,\" which etymologically it ought to mean, is made obscure by its application to \"helmets\" in stanzas 3 and 17.]",

				"2. Then the followers, hiding | their falseness, all drank\nTheir wine in the war-hall, | of the Huns' wrath wary;\nAnd Knefröth spake loudly, | his words were crafty,\nThe hero from the south, | on the high bench sitting:\n\n3. \"Now Atli has sent me | his errand to ride,\nOn my bit-champing steed | through Myrkwood the secret,\nTo bid You, Gunnar, | to his benches to come,\nWith helms round the hearth, | and Atli's home seek.\n\n4. \"Shields shall ye choose there, | and shafts made of ash-wood,\nGold-adorned helmets, | and slaves out of Hunland,\n\n[2. ~<Falseness~>: i.e., Gunnar's followers concealed their fear and hatred of the Huns at the feast; but the word may mean \"fear of treachery.\" ~<War-hall~>: the word used is \"Valhall,\" the name of Othin's hall of slain warriors.\n\n3. ~<Myrkwood the secret~> (the adjective is literally \"unknown\") the which divided Atli's realm from that of the Gjukungs; cf. ~<Oddrunargratr~>, 23 and note. ~<Around the hearth~>: the adjective is the same one which is applied to \"benches\" in stanza 1 (cf. note); it may be an error here, or it may possibly have the force of \"of your followers,\" i.e., Gunnar is to arm the men of his household (those who are round his hearth) for the journey.\n\n4. ~<Slaves~>, etc.: some editions have \"swords in plenty.\" ~<Scarlet~>: the word apparently means \"slaughter-red,\" \"blood-red,\" but it may mean something entirely different.]",

				"Silver-gilt saddle-cloths, | shirts of bright scarlet,\nWith lances and spears too, | and bit-champing steeds.\n\n5. \"The field shall be given you | of wide Gnitaheith,\nWith loud-ringing lances, | and stems gold-o'er-laid,\nTreasures full huge, | and the home of Danp,\nAnd the mighty forest | that Myrkwood is called.\"\n\n6. His head turned Gunnar, | and to Hogni he said:\n\"What thy counsel, young hero, | when such things we hear?\nNo gold do I know | on Gnitaheith lying\nSo fair that other | its equal we have not.\n\n7. \"We have seven halls, | each of swords is full,\n\n[5. ~<Gnitaheith~>: here the dragon Fafnir had his lair (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 11). Sigurth doubtless owned it after Fafnir's death, and the Gjukungs after they had killed Sigurth. Possibly they had given it to Atli in recompense for the death of his sister, Brynhild, and he now offered to restore it to them, or--as seems more likely--the poet was not very clear about its ownership himself. ~<Stems~>: i.e., the gilded stems of ships, carved like dragons,--an evident northern touch, if the word is correct, which is by no means certain . ~<Danp~>: this name was early applied to a mythical Danish king (cf. ~<Rigsthula~>, 49 and note) but it may have been fabricated by error out of the word \"DanparstaÞir\" (the phrase here used is \"staÞi Danpar\"), used in the ~<Hervararsaga~> of a field of battle between the Goths and the Huns, and quite possibly referring to the region of the Dnieper. The name seems to have clung to the Atli tradition long after it had lost all definite significance. ~<Myrkwood~>: cf. note on stanza 3.]",

				"(And all of gold | is the hilt of each;)\nMy steed is the swiftest, | my sword is sharpest,\nMy bows adorn benches, | my byrnies are golden,\nMy helm is the brightest | that came from Kjar's hall,\n(Mine own is better | than all the Huns' treasure.)\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n8. \"What seeks she to say, | that she sends us a ring,\nWoven with a wolf's hair? | methinks it gives warning;\nIn the red ring a hair | of the heath-dweller found I,\nWolf-like shall our road be | if we ride on this journey.\"\n\n9. Not eager were his comrades, | nor the men of his kin,\n\n[7. The stanza is clearly in bad shape; the manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza. In line 5 the manuscript has \"and shield\" after \"helm.\" ~<Kjar~>: Gering ingeniously identifies this Kjar with Kjar the father of Olrun, mentioned in the ~<Völundarkvitha~>, introductory prose and stanza 2, on the basis of a genealogy in the ~<Flateyjarbok~>, in which Authi, the grand father of Kjar (by no means certainly the same man) and Buthli, father of Atli, are mentioned as making a raiding voyage together. This identification, however, rests on slight evidence.\n\n8. The manuscript does not name the speaker. One editor gives the first sentence to Gunnar. ~<She~>, etc.: Guthrun, seeking to warn her brothers of Atli's treachery, sends them a ring with a wolf's hair as a sign of danger; in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) she sends a message written in runes; cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>. ~<Heath-dweller~>: wolf.]",

				"The wise nor the wary, | nor the warriors bold.\nBut Gunnar spake forth | as befitted a king,\nNoble in the beer-hall, | and bitter his scorn:\n\n10. \"Stand forth now, Fjornir! | and hither on the floor\nThe beakers all golden | shalt thou bring to the warriors.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n11. \"The wolves then shall rule | the wealth of the Niflungs,\nWolves aged and grey-hued, | if Gunnar is lost,\nAnd black-coated bears | with rending teeth bite,\nAnd make glad the dogs, | if Gunnar returns not.\"\n\n[9. In line 1 the manuscript has \"His comrades did not urge Gunnar,\" but the name, involving a metrical error, seems to have been inserted through a scribal blunder.\n\n10. The manuscript indicates no lacuna, but probably two lines have dropped out, for the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase runs: \"Give us to drink in great cups, for it may well be that this shall be our last feast.\" ~<Fjornir~>: Gunnar's cup-bearer.\n\n11. Bugge thinks this stanza is spoken by Gunnar's terrified followers; Grundtvig assigns it to Hogni. Apparently, however, Gunnar means that if he and his men are not valiant enough to make the journey and return safely, it matters little what may happen to them. ~<Niflungs~>: regarding the application of this name to Gunnar's Burgundians cf. ~<Brot~>, 17 and note. ~<Bears~>: these \"black\" bears have been used as arguments against the Greenland origin of the poem. ~<And make glad the dogs~>: i.e., by giving them corpses to eat, but the phrase in the original is more than doubtful.]",

				"12. A following gallant | fared forth with the ruler,\nYet they wept as their home | with the hero they left;\nAnd the little heir | of Hogni called loudly:\n\"Go safe now, ye wise ones, | wherever ye will!\"\n\n13. Then let the bold heroes | their bit-champing horses\nOn the mountains gallop, | and through Myrkwood the secret;\nAll Hunland was shaken | where the hard-souled ones rode,\nOn the whip-fearers fared they | through fields that were green.\n\n14. Then they saw Atli's halls, | and his watch-towers high,\n\n[12. Some editions in line 2 read \"home of the Niflungs\" instead of \"their home,\" and others \"home of the Huns,\" the manuscript reading being \"home of the men.\" ~<Heir~>: the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 28) names two sons of Hogni, Snævar and Solar, both of whom make the journey with their father and are killed. The ~<Volsungasaga~>, combining the two versions, says that Snævar and Solar went with their father, and implies that it was a third and still younger son who said: \"Farewell, and have a good time\" (thus literally).\n\n11. ~<Myrkwood~>: cf. stanza 3 and note; the journey is here made by land, whereas in the ~<Atlamol~> it is made partly by boat; cf. ~<Atlamol~>, 34 and note. ~<Whip-fearers~>: horses, but there is some uncertainty as to the word.\n\n13. In line 1 the manuscript has \"land\" instead of \"halls,\" which involves a metrical error. ~<Watch-towers~>: the word used is identical with the name of Othin's watch-tower, Hlithskjolf (cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose). ~<Buthli~>: the manuscript has \"Bikki,\" which has led some editors to transfer this stanza to]",

				"On the walls so lofty | stood the warriors of Buthli;\nThe hall of the southrons | with seats was surrounded,\nWith targets bound | and shields full bright.\n\n15. Mid weapons and lances | did Atli his wine\nIn the war-hall drink, | without were his watchmen,\nFor Gunnar they waited, | if forth he should go,\nWith their ringing spears | they would fight with the ruler.\n\n16. This their sister saw, | as soon as her brothers\nHad entered the hall,-- | little ale had she drunk:\n\"Betrayed art thou, Gunnar! | what guard hast thou, hero,\n'Gainst the plots of the Huns? | from the hall flee swiftly!\n\n17. \"Brother, 'twere far better | to have come in byrnie,\nWith thy household helmed, | to see Atli's home,\n\n[the ~<Hamthesmol~>, placing it between stanzas 16 and 17; it seems more likely, however, that \"Bikki\" was a scribal error for \"Buthli.\" Regarding Bikki cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 63 and note. Line 4 is apparently in Fornyrthislag.\n\n15. Line 1 in the manuscript is apparently incorrectly copied, and some editions omit \"Mid weapons and lances\" and assume a gap in either line 1 or line 3.\n\n17. This may be the remains of two stanzas, the manuscript marks line 5 as beginning a new stanza. Editorial conjectures are]",

				"And to sit in the saddle | all day 'neath the sun,\n(That the sword-norns might weep | for the death-pale warriors,\nAnd the Hunnish shield-maids | might shun not the sword,)\nAnd send Atli himself | to the den of the snakes;\n(Now the den of the snakes | for thee is destined.\n\n~<Gunnar spake:~>\n18. . . . . .  . . . . .\n\"Too late is it, sister, | to summon the Niflungs,\nLong is it to come | to the throng of our comrades,\nThe heroes gallant, | from the hills of the Rhine.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n19. Then Gunnar they seized, | and they set him in chains,\n\n[numerous and varied. ~<Household~>: the phrase is the same \"helms round the hearth\" commented on in stanza 3. Some editions insert a conjectural line after line 3. ~<Sword-norns~>, etc.: the line is exceedingly obscure, and the phrase rendered \"sword-norns\" may mean \"corpse-norns.\" Apparently it refers to the warrior-women of the Huns, the \"shield-maids\" of line 5 and of stanza 45. Roman writers refer to the warrior-women among the early Germanic tribes, and the tradition, closely allied to that of the Valkyries, attached itself readily to the ferocious Huns. ~<Den of snakes~>: concerning the manner of Gunnar's death cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>.\n\n18. The manuscript indicates no lacuna and does not name the speaker; perhaps a line similar to line 1 of stanza 24 (or 26) should be inserted here. ~<Rhine~>: Gunnar's Burgundian home is here clearly localized. After this stanza it is probable that a passage describing the battle has been lost.\n\n19. These two lines, apparently the remains of a full stanza,]",

				"The Burgundians' king, | and fast they bound him.\n\n20. Hogni slew seven | with sword so keen,\nAnd an eighth he flung | in the fire hot;\nA hero should fight | with his foemen thus,\nAs Hogni strove | in Gunnar's behalf.\n\n21. . . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nThe leader they asked | if his life he fain\nWith gold would buy, | the king of the Goths.\n\n~<Gunnar spake:~>\n22. \"First the heart of Hogni | shall ye lay in my hands,\n\n[may belong after stanza 20. ~<Burgundians' king~>: the phrase may mean \"Burgundians' men,\" i.e., they bound all the Burgundians who were left alive after the battle. This is the only place in the poems in which the name \"Burgundian\" appears; that the poet had no very clear conception of its meaning is indicated by the fact that in stanza 21 he calls Gunnar \"king of the Goths.\"\n\n20. Apparently a Fornyrthislag stanza, though most editions have attempted to expand the lines into Malahattr. The exploits of Hogni (Hagene), with the names of many of his victims, are told in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>. ~<The fire~>: in the Nibelungenlied Kriemhild has the hall set on fire, and the Burgundians fight amid the flames. Line 4 is clearly defective, and some editors regard the name \"Gunnar\" as all that is left of the first two lines of stanza 21.\n\n21. Again apparently the remains of a Fornyrthislag stanza. Editors have attempted various combinations of the lines. ~<Gold~>: presumably Sigurth's treasure.\n\n22. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker; perhaps a first line similar to line 1 of stanza 24 should appear here. Some editors, however, assume that a line is missing after line 3.]",

				"All bloody from the breast | of the bold one cut\nWith ke-en-biting sword, | from the son of the king.\"\n\n23. . . . . .  . . . . .\nThey cut out the heart | from the breast of Hjalli,\nOn a platter they bore it, | and brought it to Gunnar.\n\n24. Then Gunnar spake forth, | the lord of the folk:\n\"Here have I the heart | of Hjalli the craven,\nUnlike to the heart | of Hogni the valiant,\nFor it trembles still | as it stands on the platter;\nTwice more did it tremble | in the breast of the man.\n\n25. Then Hogni laughed | when they cut out the heart\nOf the living helm-hammerer; | tears he had not.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nOn a platter they bore it, | and brought it to Gunnar.\n\n[Gunnar demands proof that Hogni is dead because, as stanza 29 shows, he is unwilling to die himself until he is assured that the secret of the treasure will perish with him. He did not, of course, intend that the heart should be cut from the living Hogni.\n\n23. Most editions assume a gap (lines 1-2, 2-3 or 3-4). ~<Hjalli~>: Atli's cook, killed to deceive Gunnar, as Atli hoped to wring the secret of the hoard from Hogni if Gunnar remained silent. In the ~<Atlamol~> (stanzas 59-60) Atli's men prepare to kill Hjalli, but he is spared at Hogni's intercession.\n\n25. ~<Helm-hammerer~> (literally \"helmet-smith\"): warrior, i.e., Hogni. No gap indicated in the manuscript.]",

				"26. Then Gunnar spake forth, | the spear of the Niflungs:\n\"Here have I the heart | of Hogni the valiant,\nUnlike to the heart | of Hjalli the craven,\nLittle it trembles | as it lies on the platter,\nStill less did it tremble | when it lay in his breast.\n\n27. \"So distant, Atli, | from all men's eyes,\nShalt thou be as thou | . . . . . from the gold.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n28. \"To no one save me | is the secret known\nOf the Niflungs' hoard, | now Hogni is dead;\nOf old there were two, | while we twain were alive,\nNow is none but I, | for I only am living.\n\n29. \"The swift Rhine shall hold | the strife-gold of heroes,\nThat once was the gods', | the wealth of the Niflungs,\n\n[26. Line 1 may belong elsewhere (stanzas 18 or 22).\n\n27. Apparently the remains of two Fornyrthislag lines; the manuscript combines them with lines 1-2 of stanza 28. Gunnar foretells Atli's speedy death.\n\n28. Apparently in Fornyrthislag. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3-4 with stanza 29. This stanza explains Gunnar's demand for Hogni's heart in stanza 22.\n\n29. The manuscript marks line 3, and not line 1, as the beginning of a stanza. ~<Rhine~>, etc.: the stanza shows the blending of]",

				"In the depths of the waters | the death-rings shall glitter,\nAnd not shine on the hands | of the Hunnish men.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n30. \"Ye shall bring the wagon, | for now is he bound.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n31. On the long-maned Glaum | rode Atli the great,\nAbout him were warriors |  . . . . .\nBut Guthrun, akin | to the gods of slaughter,\nYielded not to her tears | in the hall of tumult.\n\n[three different traditions with regard to the treasure: the German tradition of the gold of the Rhine (cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 16, and ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 16), the tradition, likewise German, of the hoard of the Nibelungen (Niflungs), early blended with the first one, and finally the northern tradition of the theft of Andvari's treasure by Othin, Hönir, and Loki (cf. ~<Reginsmol~>, 1-9).\n\n30. Apparently all that is left of a full stanza. The manuscript does not name Atli as the speaker, and Grundtvig inserts: \"Then Atli called, | the king of the Huns,\" as a first line. Some editors combine this line with the two lines of stanza 33. ~<Wagon~>: in ~<Brot~>, 16, Gunnar is led to his death in the serpents' den on horseback, not in a wagon.\n\n31. The stanza in the original is hopelessly confused. ~<Glaum~>: this horse of Atli's is mentioned by name elsewhere. ~<Long-maned~>: uncertain. The manuscript indicates no gap, but something has evidently been lost. ~<Gods of slaughter~>: perhaps the phrase, usually applied to Othin and the other gods, is here used simply to mean \"heroes,\" i.e., Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. Line 4 suggests Guthrun's tearlessness after Sigurth's death (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 11)]",

				"Guthrun spake:\n32. \"It shall go with thee, Atli, | as with Gunnar thou heldest\nThe oaths ofttimes sworn, | and of old made firm,\nBy the sun in the south, | by Sigtyr's mountain,\nBy the horse of the rest-bed, | and the ring of Ull.\"\n\n33. Then the champer of bits | drew the chieftain great,\nThe gold-guarder, down | to the place of death.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n34. By the warriors' host | was the living hero\nCast in the den | where crawling about\nWithin were serpents, | but soon did Gunnar\nWith his hand in wrath | on the harp-strings smite;\n\n[32. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. ~<Sigtyr~> (\"Victory-God\"): Othin; what particular mountain (if any) is meant is unknown. ~<Horse of the rest-bed~>: probably this means \"bedpost,\" i.e., the support of the marriage-bed. ~<Ull~>: the archer god, cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 5 and note. Nothing is known of his ring.\n\n33. Apparently the remains of a Fornyrthislag stanza. Some editors combine the two lines with the line here indicated as stanza 30. ~<Champer of bits~>: horse. The manuscript indicates no gap.\n\n54. Six Fornyrthislag lines which editors have tried to reconstruct in all sorts of ways. The manuscript marks line 5 as the beginning of a new stanza, Regarding the serpents' den, Gunnar's harp-playing, and the manner of his death, cf. ~<Drop Niflunga~> and ~<Oddrunargratr~>, 27-30, and notes. In ~<Atlamol~>, 62, Gunnar plays the harp with his feet, his hands being bound, and some editors change hand in line 4 to \"foot.\" Lines 5-6 may be interpolated, or, as Bugge maintains, lines 1-4 may have been expanded out of two lines.]",

				"The strings resounded,-- | so shall a hero,\nA ring-breaker, gold | from his enemies guard.\n\n35. Then Atli rode | on his earth-treading steed,\nSeeking his home, | from the slaughter-place;\nThere was clatter of hoofs | of the steeds in the court,\nAnd the clashing of arms | as they came from the field.\n\n36. Out then came Guthrun | to meeting with Atli,\nWith a golden beaker | as gift to the monarch:\n\"Thou mayst eat now, chieftain, | within thy dwelling,\nBlithely with Guthrun | young beasts fresh slaughtered.\"\n\n37. The wine-heavy ale-cups | of Atli resounded,\nWhen there in the hall | the Hunnish youths clamored,\nAnd the warriors bearded, | the brave ones, entered.\n\n[35.

Line 1 appears to be in Fornyrthislag. Guthrun distributes Atli's treasures among his followers apparently to prevent their wrath at the slaying of Erp and Eitil from turning against her; Atli, as stanza 43 shows, is too drunk to realize or prevent what she is doing.\n\n43.

				"~<Atlamol En Grönlenzku~>\n\n~<The Greenland Ballad of Atli~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nMany of the chief facts regarding the ~<Atlamol~>, which follows the ~<Atlakvitha~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, are outlined in the introductory note to the earlier Atli lay. That the superscription in the manuscript is correct, and that the poem was actually composed in Greenland, is generally accepted; the specific reference to polar bears (stanza 17), and the general color of the entire poem make this origin exceedingly likely. Most critics, again, agree in dating the poem nearer 1100 than 1050. As to its state of preservation there is some dispute, but, barring one or two possible gaps of some importance, and the usual number of passages in which the interpolation or omission of one or two lines may be suspected, the ~<Atlamol~> has clearly come down to us in fairly good shape.\n\nThroughout the poem the epic quality of the story itself is overshadowed by the romantically sentimental tendencies of the poet, and by his desire to adapt the narrative to the understanding of his fellow-Greenlanders. The substance of the poem is the same as that of the ~<Atlakvitha~>; it tells of Atli's message to the sons of Gjuki, their journey to Atli's home, the slaying of Hogni and Gunnar, Guthrun's bitterness over the death of her brothers, and her bloody revenge on Atli. Thus in its bare out line the ~<Atlamol~> represents simply the Frankish blending of the legends of the slaughter of the Burgundians and the death of Attila (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, introductory note). But here the resemblance ends. The poet has added characters, apparently of his own creation, for the sake of episodes which would appeal to both the men and the women of the Greenland settlement. Sea voyages take the place of journeys by land; Atli is reproached, not for cowardice in battle, but for weakness at the Thing or great council. The additions made by the poet are responsible for the ~<Atlamol's~> being the longest of all the heroic poems in the Eddic collection, and they give it a kind of emotional vivid ness, but it has little of the compressed intensity of the older poems. Its greatest interest lies in its demonstration of the manner in which a story brought to the North from the South Germanic lands could be adapted to the understanding and tastes of its",

				"eleventh century hearers without any material change of the basic narrative.\n\nIn what form or forms the story of the Gjukungs and Atli reached the Greenland poet cannot be determined, but it seems likely that he was familiar with older poems on the subject, and possibly with the ~<Atlakvitha~> itself. That the details which are peculiar to the ~<Atlamol~>, such as the figures of Kostbera and Glaumvor, existed in earlier tradition seems doubtful, but the son of Hogni, who aids Guthrun in the slaying of Atli, appears, though under another name, in other late versions of the story, and it is impossible to say just how much the poet relied on his own imagination and how far he found suggestions and hints in the prose or verse stories of Atli with which he was familiar.\n\nThe poem is in Malahattr (cf. Introduction) throughout, the verse being far more regular than in the ~<Atlakvitha~>. The compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> evidently knew it in very much the form in which we now have it, for in the main it is paraphrased with great fidelity.\n\n1. There are many who know | how of old did men\nIn counsel gather; | little good did they get;\nIn secret they plotted, | it was sore for them later,\nAnd for Gjuki's sons, | whose trust they deceived.\n\n2. Fate grew for the princes, | to death they were given;\nIll counsel was Atli's, | though keenness he had;\n\n[1. ~<Men~>: Atli and his advisers, with whom he planned the death of the sons of ~<Gjuki~>, Gunnar and Hogni. The poet's reference to the story as well known explains the abruptness of his introduction, without the mention of Atli's name, and his reference to Guthrun in stanza 3 simply as \"the woman\" (\"husfreyja,\" goddess of the house).\n\n2. ~<Princes~>: Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. ~<Bulwark~>: Atli's slaying]",

				"He felled his staunch bulwark, | his own sorrow fashioned,\nSoon a message he sent | that his kinsmen should seek him.\n\n3. Wise was the woman, | she fain would use wisdom,\nShe saw well what meant | all they said in secret;\nFrom her heart it was hid | how help she might render,\nThe sea they should sail, | while herself she should go not.\n\n4. Runes did she fashion, | but false Vingi made them,\nThe speeder of hatred, | ere to give them he sought;\nThen soon fared the warriors | whom Atli had sent,\nAnd to Limafjord came, | to the home of the kings.\n\n5. They were kindly with ale, | and fires they kindled,\n\n[of his wife's brothers, who were ready to support and defend him in his greatness, was the cause of his own death.\n\n3. ~<The woman~>: Guthrun, concerning whose marriage to Atli cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II.~> ~<The sea~>: a late and essentially Greenland variation of the geography of the Atli story. Even the ~<Atlakvitha~>, perhaps half a century earlier, separates Atli's land from that of the Gjukungs only by a forest.\n\n4. ~<Runes~>: on the two versions of Guthrun's warning, and also on the name of the messenger (here Vingi), cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~> and note. ~<Limafjord~>: probably the Limfjord of northern Jutland, an important point in the wars of the eleventh century. The name was derived from \"Eylimafjorþ,\" i.e., Eylimi's fjord. The poet may really have thought that the kingdom of the Burgundians was in Jutland, or he may simply have taken a well-known name for the sake of vividness.]",

				"They thought not of craft | from the guests who had come;\nThe gifts did they take | that the noble one gave them,\nOn the pillars they hung them, | no fear did they harbor.\n\n6. Forth did Kostbera, | wife of Hogni, then come,\nFull kindly she was, | and she welcomed them both;\nAnd glad too was Glaumvor, | the wife of Gunnar,\nShe knew well to care | for the needs of the guests.\n\n7. Then Hogni they asked | if more eager he were,\nFull clear was the guile, | if on guard they had been;\nThen Gunnar made promise, | if Hogni would go,\nAnd Hogni made answer | as the other counseled.\n\n8. Then the famed ones brought mead, | and fair was the feast,\n\n[5. Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.\n\n6. Some editions place this stanza between stanzas 7 and 8. ~<Kostbera~> (\"The Giver of Food\") and ~<Glaumvor~> (\"The Merry\"): presumably creations of the poet. ~<Both~>: Atli's two emissaries, Vingi and the one here unnamed (Knefröth?).\n\n7. It is altogether probable that a stanza has been lost between stanzas 6 and 7, in which Gunnar is first invited, and replies doubtfully. ~<Made promise~>: many editions emend the text to read \"promised the journey.\" The text of line 4 is obscure; the manuscript reads \"nitti\" (\"refused\"), which many editors have changed to \"hlitti,\" which means exactly the opposite. 8. No gap is indicated in the manuscript; Bugge adds (line]",

Others suggest the loss of a line after line 4.\n\n9. The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as the beginning of a stanza; cf. note on stanza 8.\n\n10. Some editions combine this stanza with lines 1-2 of stanza 11. The manuscript indicates no gap. Grundtvig adds (line 2) \"But sleep to the woman | so wise came little.\"\n\n11. Some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 1-2, or combine them with stanza 10, and combine lines 3-4 with stanza]",

The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza.\n\n12. Line 5 may be spurious, or else all that is left of a lost stanza. The manuscript marks it as the beginning of a new stanza, which, as the text stands, is clearly impossible.\n\n13. The manuscript, followed by some editions, has \"Hogni spake\" in the middle of line 1. ~<Ill~>: the manuscript and many editions have \"this.\" ~<The king~>: Atli.\n\n14.

The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. In any case, the lost lines cannot materially have altered the meaning.\n\n15. ~<Saw I~>: the manuscript here, as also in stanzas 16, 18, 2r, 22, and 24, has \"methought,\" which involves a metrical error. Some editors regard lines 3-4 as the remains of a four-line stanza. Regarding Kostbera's warning dreams, and Hogni's matter-of-fact interpretations of them, cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 39-44.\n\n16. The meaning of the first half of line 3 in the original is obscure.]",

Two lines may have been lost after line 2, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase gives no clue. ~<Ice-bear~>: polar bears, common in Greenland, are very rarely found in Iceland, and never in Norway, a fact which substantiates the manuscript's reference to Greenland as the home of the poem.\n\n18. The manuscript indicates no gap, but most editors assume the loss of a line after line 1 or 2; Grundtvig adds, after line 1: \"Black were his feathers, | with blood was he covered.\" ~<Atli's spirit~>: the poet's folk-lore seems here a bit weak. Presumably he means such a female following-spirit (\"fylgja\") as appears in ~<Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar~>, prose following stanza 34 (cf. note thereon), but the word he uses, \"hamr\" (masculine) means \"skin,\" \"shape.\" He may, however, imply that Atli had assumed the shape of an eagle for this occasion.\n\n19. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza.]",

The proper location for' the missing words is sheer guesswork. ~<Two roads~>: probably the meaning is that their way (i.e., their success) would be doubtful.\n\n21. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers in this dialogue (stanzas 21-26). No gap is indicated after line 2. Most editors assume the loss of two lines or of a full stanza after]",

				"Such a dream is hard | o a husband to tell,--\nA spear stood, methought, | through thy body thrust,\nAnd at head and feet | the wolves were howling.\"\n\n~<Gunnar spake:~>\n23. \"The hounds are running, | loud their barking is heard,\nOft hounds' clamor follows | the flying of spears.\"\n\n~<Glaumvor spake:~>\n24. \"A river the length | of the hall saw I run,\nFull swiftly it roared, | o'er the benches it swept;\nO'er the feet did it break | of ye brothers twain,\nThe water would yield not; | some meaning there was.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n25. \"I dreamed that by night | came dead women hither,\n\n[stanza 21 giving Gunnar's interpretation of Glaumvor's dream, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> gives no clue, as it does not mention this first dream at all. Grundtvig suggests as Gunnar's answer: \"Banners are gleaming, | since of gallows didst dream, / And wealth it must mean | that thou serpents didst watch.\" ~<Gods' doom~>: an odd, and apparently mistaken, use of the phrase \"ragna rök\" (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, introductory note).\n\n25. Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2. Possibly the concluding phrase of line 2 should be \"bloody spears,\" as in the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase.\n\n24.

Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza.\n\n27. ~<Five~>: Gunnar, Hogni, and the three mentioned in Stanza 28.\n\n28.

Hild for Brynhild (~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, 6). The manuscript indicates no gap; Grundtvig inserts (line 2): \"And clear was her cry to her kinsmen dear.\"\n\n32. Hogni's method of cheering his wife and sister-in-law is somewhat unusual, for the meaning of lines 3-4 is that good wishes and blessings are of little use in warding off danger.\n\n33. Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2; Grundtvig supplies: \"Then weeping did | Glaumvor go to her rest-bed, / And sadly did Bera | her spinning wheel seek.\"\n\n34. ~<Keel~>, etc.: in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, and presumably in the older German tradition, Hagene breaks his oar steering the Burgundians across the Danube (stanza 1564), and, after all have landed, splinters the boat (stanza 1581) in order that there may be no retreating. The poet here seems to have confused the story,]",

				"The oar-loops were burst, | the thole-pins, were broken,\nNor the ship made they fast | ere from her they fared.\n\n35. Not long was it after-- | the end must I tell--\nThat the home they beheld | that Buthli once had;\nLoud the gates resounded | when Hogni smote them;\nVingi spake then a word | that were better unsaid:\n\n36. \"Go ye far from the house, | for false is its entrance,\nSoon shall I burn you, | ye are swiftly smitten;\nI bade ye come fairly, | but falseness was under,\nNow bide ye afar | while your gallows I fashion.\"\n\n37.

The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and many editions combine it with stanza 36, some of them assuming the loss of a line from stanza 35. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase the second half of line 4 is made a part of Vingi's speech: \"Better had ye left this undone.\"\n\n36. Cf. note on preceding stanza; the manuscript does not indicate line I as beginning a stanza. Line 3 may be spurious.\n\n37. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase the second half of line 1 and the first half of line 2 are included in Hogni's speech.]",

Possibly two lines have been lost after line 2.\n\n39. It is probable that a considerable passage has been lost between stanzas 39 and 40, for the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase includes a dialogue at this point. The manuscript indicates no gap, and most editions combine stanzas 39 and 40 as a single stanza. The prose passage, indicating the substance of what, if any thing, is lost, runs as follows: \"'Be welcome among us, and give me that store of gold which is ours by right, the gold that Sigurth had, and that now belongs to Guthrun.' Gunnar said: 'Never shalt thou get that gold, and men of might shalt thou find here, ere we give up our lives, if it is battle thou dost offer us; in truth it seems that thou hast prepared this feast in kingly fashion,]",

				"\"Long since did we plan | how soon we might slay you.\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n41. \"Little it matters | if long ye have planned it;\nFor unarmed do ye wait, | and one have we felled,\nWe smote him to hell, | of your host was he once.\"\n\n42.

These two lines, which most editions combine with stanza 39, may be the first or last two of a four-line stanza. The ~<Volsungasaga~> gives Atli's speech very much as it appears here.\n\n41. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker; Grundtvig adds as a first line: \"Then Hogni laughed loud where the slain Vingi lay.\" Many editors assume the loss of a line somewhere in the stanza. ~<Unarmed~>: Hogni does not see Atli's armed followers, who are on the other side of the courtyard (stanza 39). One: Vingi.\n\n42. Most editors assume the loss of one line, after either line 1 or line 3.\n\n45. The manuscript reading of lines 1-2, involving a metrical error, is: \"In the house came the word | of the warring without, / Loud in front of the hall | they heard a thrall shouting.\" Some editors assume a gap of two lines after line]",

				"Fought in front of the hall; | they heard a thrall tell it;\nGrim then was Guthrun, | the grief when she heard,\nWith necklaces fair, | and she flung them all from her,\n(The silver she hurled | so the rings burst asunder.)\n\n44. Then out did she go, | she flung open the doors,\nAll fearless she went, | and the guests did she welcome;\nTo the Niflungs she went-- | her last greeting it was,--\nIn her speech truth was clear, | and much would she speak.\n\n45. \"For your safety I sought | that at home ye should stay;\nNone escapes his fate, | so ye hither must fare.\"\nFull wisely she spake, | if yet peace they might win,\n\n[2, the missing passage giving the words of the thrall. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editions make a separate stanza of lines 3-5, same of them assuming the loss of a line after line 3. With the stanza as here given, line 5 may well be spurious.\n\n44. ~<Niflungs~>: regarding the application of this term to the Burgundians cf. ~<Atlakvitha~>, 11, and ~<Brot~>, 17, and notes. The manuscript here spells the name with an initial N, as elsewhere, but in stanza 83 the son of Hogni appears with the name \"Hniflung.\" In consequence, some editors change the form in this stanza to \"Hniflungs,\" while others omit the initial H in both cases. I have followed the manuscript, though admittedly its spelling is illogical.]",

				"But to nought would they hearken, | and \"No\" said they all.\n\n46. Then the high-born one saw | that hard was their battle,\nIn fierceness of heart | she flung off her mantle;\nHer naked sword grasped she | her kin's lives to guard,\nNot gentle her hands | in the hewing of battle.\n\n47. Then the daughter of Gjuki | two warriors smote down,\nAtli's brother she slew, | and forth then they bore him;\n(So fiercely she fought | that his feet she clove off;)\nAnother she smote | so that never he stood,\nTo hell did she send him,-- | her hands trembled never.\n\n[46. The warlike deeds of Guthrun represent an odd transformation of the German tradition. Kriemhild, although she did no actual fighting in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, was famed from early times for her cruelty and fierceness of heart, and this seems to have inspired the poet of the ~<Atlamol~> to make his Guthrun into a warrior outdoing Brynhild herself. Kriemhild's ferocity of course, was directed against Gunther and especially Hagene, for whose slaying she rather than Etzel was responsible; here, on the other hand, Guthrun's is devoted to the defense of her brothers.\n\n47. Line 3 is very likely an interpolation. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5. ~<Atli's brother~>: doubtless a reminiscence of the early tradition represented in the ~<Nibelungenlied~> by the slaying of Etzel's brother, Blœdelin (the historical Bleda), by Dancwart.]",

Full wide was the fame | of the battle they fought,\n'Twas the greatest of deeds | of the sons of Gjuki;\nMen say that the Niflungs, | while themselves they were living,\nWith their swords fought mightily, | mail-coats they sundered,\nAnd helms did they hew, | as their hearts were fearless.\n\n49. All the morning they fought | until midday shone,\n(All the dusk as well | and the dawning of day,)\nWhen the battle was ended, | the field flowed with blood;\nEre they fell, eighteen | of their foemen were slain,\nBy the two sons of Bera | and her brother as well.\n\n50. Then the warrior spake, | and wild was his anger:\n\"This is evil to see, | and thy doing is all;\n\n[48. Line 3 may well be spurious, for it implies that Gunnar and Hogni were killed in battle, whereas they were taken prisoners. Some editors, in an effort to smooth out the inconsistency, change \"themselves\" in this line to \"sound.\" Line 5 has also been questioned as possibly interpolated. ~<Niflungs~>: on the spelling of this name in the manuscript and the various editions cf. note on stanza 44.\n\n49. Line 2 is probably an interpolation, and the original apparently lacks a word. There is some obscurity as to the exact meaning of lines 4-5. ~<The two sons of Bera~>: Snævar and Solar; ~<her brother~> is Orkning; cf. stanza 28.\n\n50. ~<The warrior~>: Atli. ~<Thirty~>: perhaps an echo of the \"thirty warriors\" of Thjothrek (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, 5). Subtracting the eighteen killed by Snævar, Solar and Orkning (stanza 49), and Vingi, killed by the whole company (stanza]",

We lay seldom together | since to me thou wast given,\nNow my kin all are gone, | of my gold am I robbed;\nNay, and worst, thou didst send | my sister to hell.\"\n\n[38), we have eleven left, as Atli says, but this does not allow much for the exploits of Gunnar and Hogni, who, by this reckoning, seem to have killed nobody. The explanation probably is that lines 4-5 of stanza 49 are in bad shape.\n\n51. ~<Five brothers~>: the ~<Volsungasaga~> speaks of four (not five) sons of Buthli, but names only Atli. Regarding the death of the first two brothers cf. stanza 91 and note. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3-4 with stanza 52. Some insert lines 2-3 of stanza 52 ahead of lines 3-4 of stanza 51.\n\n52. Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza, which is impossible unless something has been lost. ~<Gold~>: the meaning of this half line is somewhat doubtful, but apparently Atli refers to Sigurth's treasure, which should have been his as Brynhild's brother. ~<Sister~>: Brynhild; regarding Guthrun's indirect responsibility for Brynhild's death cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 45 and note.]",

The manuscript does not name the speaker. ~<The Volsungasaga~> gives the speech, in somewhat altered form, to Hogni. \"Why speakest thou so? Thou wast the first to break peace; thou didst take my kinswoman and starved her in a prison, and murdered her and took her wealth; that was not kinglike; and laughable does it seem to me that thou talkest of thy sorrow, and good shall I find it that all goes ill with thee.\" This presumably represents the correct form of the stanza, for nowhere else is it intimated that Atli killed Guthrun's mother, Grimhild, nor is the niece elsewhere mentioned. Some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5, Grundtvig adding a line after line 3 and two more after line 5. Other editors are doubtful about the authenticity of either line 3 or line 5.\n\n54. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.]",

The ~<Atlakvitha~> version of this episode (stanzas 23-25) does not mention Beiti, and in the ~<Volsungasaga~> the advice to cut out Hjalli's heart instead of Hogni's is given by an unnamed \"counsellor of Atli.\" In the ~<Atlakvitha~> Hjalli is actually killed; the ~<Volsungasaga~> combines the two versions by having Hjalli first let off at Hogni's intercession and then seized a second time and killed, thus introducing the ~<Atlakvitha~> episode of the quaking heart (stanza 24). The text of the first half of line 3 is obscure, and there are many and widely varying suggestions as to the word here rendered \"sluggard.\"\n\n58. Some editions mark line 5 as probably interpolated.]",

The ~<Volsungasaga~> does not paraphrase lines 3-5; the passage may be a later addition, and line 5 is almost certainly so.\n\n61. It is probable that a stanza describing the casting of Gunnar into the serpents' den has been lost after this stanza. ~<Sons of day~>: the phrase means no more than \"men.\"]",

Guthrun suddenly changes her tone in order to make Atli believe that she is submissive to his will, and thus to gain time for her vengeance. Line 2 in the original is thoroughly obscure; it runs literally: \"On the knee goes the fist if the twigs are taken off.\" Perhaps the word meaning \"fist\" may also have meant \"tree-top,\" as Gering suggests, or perhaps the line is an illogical blending of the ideas contained in lines 1 and 3.\n\n70. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza, ~<Two shields~>, etc.: i. e., Guthrun concealed her hostility (symbolized by a red shield, cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana~> I, 34) by a show of friendliness (a white shield).]",

				"Will it bring to either, | for all have we lost;\nBut, Guthrun, yet once | be thou kindly of will,\nFor the honor of both, | when forth I am home.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n97. \"A ship will I buy, | and a bright-hued coffin,\nI will wax well the shroud | to wind round thy body,\nFor all will I care | as if dear were we ever.\"\n\n98. Then did Atli die, | and his heirs' grief doubled;\nThe high-born one did | as to him she had promised;\nThen sought Guthrun the wise | to go to her death,\nBut for days did she wait, | and 'twas long ere she died.\n\n99. Full happy shall he be | who such offspring has,\nOr children so gallant, | as Gjuki begot;\nForever shall live, | and in lands far and wide,\nTheir valor heroic | wherever men hear it.\n\n[97. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. Many editors assume a gap either before or after line 1. ~<A ship~>: the burial of Norse chiefs in ships was of frequent occurrence, but the Greenland poet's application of the custom to Atli is some what grotesque.\n\n98. ~<Heirs~>, etc.: merely a stock phrase, here quite meaningless, as Atli's heirs had all been killed. ~<Long~>: cf. ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, introductory prose.]"
