				"~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>\n\n~<The First Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<First Lay of Guthrun~>, entitled in the ~<Codex Regius~> simply ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>, immediately follows the remaining fragment of the \"long\" Sigurth lay in that manuscript. Unlike the poems dealing with the earlier part of the Sigurth cycle, the so-called ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, it is a clear and distinct unit, apparently complete and with few and minor interpolations. It is also one of the finest poems in the entire collection, with an extraordinary emotional intensity and dramatic force. None of its stanzas are quoted elsewhere, and it is altogether probable that the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> were unfamiliar with it, for they do not mention the sister and daughter of Gjuki who appear in this poem, or Herborg, \"queen of the Huns\" (stanza 6).\n\nThe lament of Guthrun (Kriemhild) is almost certainly among the oldest parts of the story. The lament was one of the earliest forms of poetry to develop among the Germanic peoples, and I suspect, though the matter is not susceptible of proof, that the lament of Sigurth's wife had assumed lyric form as early as the seventh century, and reached the North in that shape rather than in prose tradition (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory note). We find traces of it in the seventeenth Aventiure of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, and in the poems of the ~<Edda~> it dominates every appearance of Guthrun. The two first Guthrun lays (I and II) are both laments, one for Sigurth's death and the other including both that and the lament over the slaying of her brothers; the lament theme is apparent in the third Guthrun lay and in the ~<Guthrunarhvot~>.\n\nIn their present forms the second Guthrun lay is undoubtedly older than he first; in the prose following the ~<Brot~> the annotator refers to the \"old\" Guthrun lay in terms which can apply only to the second one in the collection. The shorter and \"first\" lay, therefore, can scarcely have been composed much before the year 1000, and may be somewhat later. The poet appears to have known and made use of the older lament; stanza 17, for example, is a close parallel to stanza 2 of the earlier poem; but whatever material he used he fitted into a definite poetic scheme of his",

				"own. And while this particular poem is, as critics have generally agreed, one of the latest of the collection, it probably represents one of the earliest parts of the entire Sigurth cycle to take on verse form.\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, so far as the narrative underlying it is concerned, shows very little northern addition to the basic German tradition. Brynhild appears only as Guthrun's enemy and the cause of Sigurth's death; the three women who attempt to comfort Guthrun, though unknown to the southern stories, seem to have been rather distinct creations of the poet's than traditional additions to the legend. Regarding the relations of the various elements in the Sigurth cycle, cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>.\n\n__________________\n\nGuthrun sat by the dead Sigurth; she did not weep as other women, but her heart was near to bursting with grief. The men and women came to her to console her, but that was not easy to do. It is told of men that Guthrun had eaten of Fafnir's heart, and that she under stood the speech of birds. This is a poem about Guthrun.\n\n1. Then did Guthrun | think to die,\nWhen she by Sigurth | sorrowing sat;\nTears she had not, | nor wrung her hands,\nNor ever wailed, | as other women.\n\n[~<Prose~>. The prose follows the concluding prose of the ~<Brot~> without indication of a break, the heading standing immediately before stanza 1. ~<Fafnir's heart~>: this bit of information is here quite without point, and it is nowhere else stated that Guthrun understood the speech of birds. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> it is stated that Sigurth gave Guthrun some of Fafnir's heart to eat, \"and thereafter she was much grimmer than before, and wiser.\"\n\n1. This stanza seems to be based on Guthrunarkvitha II, 11-12.]",

				"2. To her the warriors | wise there came,\nLonging her heavy | woe to lighten;\nGrieving could not | Guthrun weep,\nSo sad her heart, | it seemed, would break.\n\n3. Then the wives | of the warriors came,\nGold-adorned, | and Guthrun sought;\nEach one then | of her own grief spoke,\nThe bitterest pain | she had ever borne.\n\n4. Then spake Gjaflaug, | Gjuki's sister:\n\"Most joyless of all | on earth am I;\nHusbands five | were from me taken,\n(Two daughters then, | and sisters three,)\nBrothers eight, | yet I have lived.\"\n\n5. Grieving could not | Guthrun weep,\nSuch grief she had | for her husband dead,\nAnd so grim her heart | by the hero's body.\n\n6. Then Herborg spake, | the queen of the Huns:\n\n[4. ~<Gjaflaug~>: nothing further is known of this aunt of Guthrun, or of the many relatives whom she has lost. Very likely she is an invention of the poet's, for it seems improbable that other wise all further trace of her should have been lost. Line 4 has been marked by many editors as spurious.\n\n5. Some editors assume the loss of a line, after either line 1 or line 3. I prefer to believe that here and in stanza 10 the poet knew exactly what he was doing, and that both stanzas are correct.\n\n6. ~<Herborg~>: neither she nor her sorrows are elsewhere mentioned,]",

				"\"I have a greater | grief to tell;\nMy seven sons | in the southern land,\nAnd my husband, fell | in fight all eight.\n(Father and mother | and brothers four\nAmid the waves | the wind once smote,\nAnd the seas crashed through | the sides of the ship.)\n\n7. \"The bodies all | with my own hands then\nI decked for the grave, | and the dead I buried;\nA half-year brought me | this to bear;\nAnd no one came | to comfort me.\n\n8. \"Then bound I was, | and taken in war,\nA sorrow yet | in the same half-year;\nThey bade me deck | and bind the shoes\nOf the wife of the monarch | every morn.\n\n9. \"In jealous rage | her wrath she spake,\nAnd beat me oft | with heavy blows;\n\n[nor is it clear what a \"queen of the Huns\" is doing in Gunnar's home, but the word \"Hun\" has little definiteness of meaning in the poems, and is frequently applied to Sigurth himself (cf. note on stanza 24). Herborg appears from stanza 11 to have been the foster-mother of Gollrond, Guthrun's sister. Lines 5-7 may be interpolations, or may form a separate stanza.\n\n7. Lines 1 and 2 stand in reversed order in the manuscript; I have followed Gering's conjectural transposition.\n\n9. Herborg implies that the queen's jealousy was not altogether misplaced.]",

				"Never a better | lord I knew,\nAnd never a woman | worse I found.\"\n\n10. Grieving could not | Guthrun weep,\nSuch grief she had | for her husband dead,\nAnd so grim her heart | by the hero's body.\n\n11. Then spake Gollrond, | Gjuki's daughter:\n\"Thy wisdom finds not, | my foster-mother,\nThe way to comfort | the wife so young.\"\nShe bade them uncover | the warrior's corpse.\n\n12. The shroud she lifted | from Sigurth, laying\nHis well-loved head | on the knees of his wife:\n\"Look on thy loved one, | and lay thy lips\nTo his as if yet | the hero lived.\"\n\n13. Once alone did | Guthrun look;\nHis hair all clotted | with blood beheld,\nThe blinded eyes | that once shone bright,\nThe hero's breast | that the blade had pierced.\n\n14. Then Guthrun bent, | on her pillow bowed,\n\n[10. Cf. stanza 5 and note. The manuscript abbreviates to first letters.\n\n11. ~<Gollrond~>: not elsewhere mentioned. Line 4 looks like an interpolation replacing a line previously lost.\n\n12. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. and some editors have attempted to follow this arrangement. Many editors assume the loss of a line from this stanza.]",

				"Her hair was loosened, | her cheek was hot,\nAnd the tears like raindrops | downward ran.\n\n15. Then Guthrun, daughter | of Gjuki, wept,\nAnd through her tresses | flowed the tears;\nAnd from the court | came the cry of geese,\nThe birds so fair | of the hero's bride.\n\n16. Then Gollrond spake, | the daughter of Gjuki:\n\"Never a greater | love I knew\nThan yours among | all men on earth;\nNowhere wast happy, | at home or abroad,\nSister mine, | with Sigurth away.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n17. \"So was my Sigurth | o'er Gjuki's sons\nAs the spear-leek grown | above the grass,\nOr the jewel bright | borne on the band,\nThe precious stone | that princes wear.\n\n18. \"To the leader of men | I loftier seemed\nAnd higher than all | of Herjan's maids;\n\n[15. The word here translated \"tresses\" is sheer guesswork. The detail of the geese is taken from ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 29, line 3 here being identical with line 4 of that stanza.\n\n16. Line 1, abbreviated in the manuscript, very likely should be simply \"Gollrond spake.\"\n\n17. Cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 2. The manuscript does not name the speaker, and some editions have a first line, \"Then Guthrun spake, the daughter of Gjuki.\"\n\n18. ~<Herjan~>: Othin; his maids are the Valkyries; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31, where the same phrase is used.]",

				"As little now | as the leaf I am\nOn the willow hanging; | my hero is dead.\n\n19. \"In his seat, in his bed, | I see no more\nMy heart's true friend; | the fault is theirs,\nThe sons of Gjuki, | for all my grief,\nThat so their sister | sorely weeps.\n\n20. \"So shall your land | its people lose\nAs ye have kept | your oaths of yore;\nGunnar, no joy | the gold shall give thee,\n(The rings shall soon | thy slayers be,)\nWho swarest oaths | with Sigurth once.\n\n21. \"In the court was greater | gladness then\nThe day my Sigurth | Grani saddled,\nAnd went forth Brynhild's | hand to win,\nThat woman ill, | in an evil hour.\"\n\n22. Then Brynhild spake, | the daughter of Buthli:\n\"May the witch now husband | and children want\nWho, Guthrun, loosed | thy tears at last,\nAnd with magic today | hath made thee speak.\"\n\n[20. Line 4 looks like an interpolation (cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, 9, line 4), but some editors instead have queried line 5. How Guthrun's curse is fulfilled is told in the subsequent poems. That desire for Sigurth's treasure (the gold cursed by Andvari and Loki) was one of the motives for his murder is indicated in ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~> (stanza 16), and was clearly a part of the German tradition, as it appears in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>.\n\n21. Cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 35 and note.\n\n22. Line 1 is abbreviated in the manuscript.]",

				"23. Then Gollrond, daughter | of Gjuki, spake:\n\"Speak not such words, | thou hated woman;\nBane of the noble | thou e'er hast been,\n(Borne thou art | on an evil wave,\nSorrow hast brought | to seven kings,)\nAnd many a woman | hast loveless made.\"\n\n24. Then Brynhild, daughter | of Buthli, spake:\n\"Atli is guilty | of all the sorrow,\n(Son of Buthli | and brother of mine,)\nWhen we saw in the hall | of the Hunnish race\nThe flame of the snake's bed | flash round the hero;\n(For the journey since | full sore have I paid,\nAnd ever I seek | the sight to forget.)\"\n\n[23. Editors are agreed that this stanza shows interpolations, but differ as to the lines to reject. Line 4 (literally \"every wave of ill-doing drives thee\") is substantially a proverb, and line 5, with its apparently meaningless reference to \"seven\" kings, may easily have come from some other source.\n\n24. The stanza is obviously in bad shape; perhaps it represents two separate stanzas, or perhaps three of the lines are later additions. ~<Atli~>: Brynhild here blames her brother, following the frequent custom of transferring the responsibility for a murder (cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>, 33), because he compelled her to marry Gunnar against her will, an idea which the poet seems to have gained from ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 32-39. These stanzas represent an entirely different version of the story, wherein Atli, attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, buys them off by giving Gunnar his sister, Brynhild, as wife. He seems to have induced the latter to marry Gunnar by falsely telling her that Gunnar was Sigurth (a rationalistic explanation of the interchange of forms described in the ~<Volsungasaga~> and ~<Gripisspo~>, 37-39). In the present stanza Atli is made to do this out of desire for Sigurth's treasure. ~<Hunnish race~>: this may be]",

				"25. By the pillars she stood, | and gathered her strength,\nFrom the eyes of Brynhild, | Buthli's daughter,\nFire there burned, | and venom she breathed,\nWhen the wounds she saw | on Sigurth then.\n\nGuthrun went thence away to a forest in the waste, and journeyed all the way to Denmark, and was there seven half-years with Thora, daughter of Hokon. Brynhild would not live after Sigurth. She had eight of her thralls slain and five serving-women. Then she killed her self with a sword, as is told in the Short Lay of Sigurth.\n\n[merely an error (neither Gunnar nor Sigurth could properly have been connected in any way with Atli and his Huns), based on ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, wherein Sigurth appears more than once as the \"Hunnish king.\" The North was very much in the dark as to the differences between Germans, Burgundians, Franks, Goths, and Huns, and used the words without much discrimination. On the other hand, it may refer to Sigurth's appearance when, adorned with gold, he came with Gunnar to besiege Atli, in the alternative version of the story just cited (cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 36). ~<Flame of the snake's bed~>: gold, so called because serpents and dragons were the' traditional guardians of treasure, on which they lay.\n\n~<Prose~>. The manuscript has \"Gunnar\" in place of \"Guthrun,\" but this is an obvious mistake; the entire prose passage is based on ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 14. The ~<Volsungasaga~> likewise merely paraphrases ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, and nothing further is known of Thora or her father, Hokon, though many inconclusive attempts have been made to identify the latter. ~<Brynhild~>: the story of her death is told in great detail in the latter part of ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>.]"

				"~<Guthrunarkvitha II, En Forna~>\n\n~<The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nIt has already been pointed out (introductory note to ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>) that the tradition of Guthrun's lament was known wherever the Sigurth story existed, and that this lament was probably one of the earliest parts of the legend to assume verse form. Whether it reached the North as verse cannot, of course, be determined, but it is at least possible that this was the case, and in any event it is clear that by the tenth and eleventh centuries there were a number of Norse poems with Guthrun's lament as the central theme. Two of these are included in the Eddic collection, the second one being unquestionably much the older. It is evidently the poem referred to by the annotator in the prose note following the ~<Brot~> as \"the old Guthrun lay,\" and its character and state of preservation have combined to lead most commentators to date it as early as the first half of the tenth century, whereas ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> belongs a hundred years later.\n\nThe poem has evidently been preserved in rather bad shape, with a number of serious omissions and some interpolations, but in just this form it lay before the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~>, who paraphrased it faithfully, and quoted five of its stanzas. The interpolations are on the whole unimportant; the omissions, while they obscure the sense of certain passages, do not destroy the essential continuity of the poem, in which Guthrun reviews her sorrows from the death of Sigurth through the slaying of her brothers to Atli's dreams foretelling the death of their sons. It is, indeed, the only Norse poem of the Sigurth cycle antedating the year 1000 which has come down to us in anything approaching complete form; the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~> are all collections of fragments, only a short bit of the \"long\" Sigurth lay remains, and the others--~<Gripisspo~>, ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> and ~<III~>, ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, ~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, ~<Oddrunargratr~>, ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, ~<Hamthesmol~>, and the two Atli lays--are all generally dated from the eleventh and even the twelfth centuries.\n\nAn added reason for believing that ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~> traces its origin back to a lament which reached the North",

				"from Germany in verse form is the absence of most characteristic Norse additions to the narrative, except in minor details. Sigurth is slain in the forest, as \"German men say\" (cf. ~<Brot~>, concluding prose); the urging of Guthrun by her mother 2nd brothers to become Atli's wife, the slaying of the Gjukungs (here only intimated, for at that point something seems to have been lost), and Guthrun's prospective revenge on Atli, all belong directly to the German tradition (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>).\n\nIn the ~<Codex Regius~> the poem is entitled simply ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>; the numeral has been added in nearly all editions to distinguish this poem from the other two Guthrun lays, and the phrase \"the old\" is borrowed from the annotator's comment in the prose note at the end of the ~<Brot~>.\n\n__________________\n\nKing Thjothrek was with Atli, and had lost most of his men. Thjothrek and Guthrun lamented their griefs together. She spoke to him, saying:\n\n1. A maid of maids | my mother bore me,\nBright in my bower, | my brothers I loved,\nTill Gjuki dowered | me with gold,\nDowered with gold, | and to Sigurth gave me.\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Thjothrek~>: the famous Theoderich, king of the Ostrogoths, who became renowned in German story as Dietrich von Bern. The German tradition early accepted the anachronism of bringing together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453, and Theoderich. who was born about 455, and adding thereto Ermanarich (Jormunrek), king of the Goths, who died about 376. Ermanarich, in German tradition, replaced Theoderich's actual enemy, Odovakar, and it was in battle with Jormunrek (i. e., Odovakar) that Thjothrek is here said to have lost most WE his men. The annotator found the material for this note in ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, in which Guthrun is accused of having Thjothrek as her lover. At the time when ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>]",

The story of how Gotthorm, was slain after killing Sigurth in his bed is told in ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, 22-23, and in the ~<Volsungasaga~>.\n\n11.

Grundtvig suggests as a first line: \"Long did I bide, | my brothers awaiting.\" Many editors reject line 4.\n\n14.

				"In like princes | came they all,\nThe long-beard men, | with mantles red,\nShort their mail-coats, | mighty their helms,\nSwords at their belts, | and brown their hair.\n\n21.

A draught did Grimhild | give me to drink,\nBitter and cold; | I forgot my cares;\n\n[supply the names of Atli's messengers, the \"long-beard men\" of line 4, who have come to ask for Guthrun's hand. Some commentators assume, as the Volsungasaga does, that these messengers went with the Gjukungs to Denmark in search of Guthrun, but it seems more likely that a transitional stanza has dropped out after stanza 19, and that Guthrun received Atli's emissaries in her brothers' home. ~<Long-beards~>: the word may actually mean Langobards or Lombards, but, if it does, it is presumably without any specific significance here. Certainly the names in the interpolated two lines do not fit either Lombards or Huns, for Valdar is identified as a Dane, and Jarizleif and Jarizskar are apparently Slavic. The manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza.\n\n21. ~<Each~>: the reference is presumably to Gunnar and Hogni, and perhaps also Grimhild, I suspect that this stanza belongs before stanza 20.\n\n22. Stanzas 22-25 describe the draught of forgetfulness which Grimhild gives Guthrun, just as she gave one to Sigurth (in one version of the story) to make him forget Brynhild. The draught does not seem to work despite Guthrun's statement in stanza 25 (cf. stanza 30), for which reason Vigfusson, not unwisely, places stanzas 22-25 after stanza 34. ~<Blood~> ~<of~> ~<swine~>: cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 39 and note.]",

The ~<Volsungasaga~> quotes stanzas 23-24. ~<Heather-fish~>: a snake. ~<Haddings' land~>: the world of the dead, so called because, according to Saxo Grammaticus, the Danish king Hadingus once visited it. It is possible that the comma should follow \"heather fish,\" making the \"ear uncut\" (of grain) come from the world of the dead.\n\n24. ~<Dew of the hearth~>: soot.\n\n25. In the manuscript, and in some editions, the first line is in the third person plural: \"Then they forgot, when the draught they had drunk.\" The second line in the original is manifestly in bad shape, and has been variously emended. I forgot: this emendation is doubtful, in view of stanza 30, but cf. note to stanza 22. The kings all three: probably Atli's emissaries, though the interpolated lines of stanza 20 name four of them. I suspect that line 4 is wrong, and should read: \"Ere he himself (Atli) to speak began.\" Certainly stanzas 26-27]",

However, the \"three kings\" may not be Atli's followers at all, but Gunnar, Hogni, and the unnamed third brother possibly referred to in ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 18.\n\n26. ~<Thy father's~>: So the manuscript, in which case the reference is obviously to Gjuki. But some editions omit the \"thy,\" and if Atli, and not Grimhild, is speaking (cf. note on stanza 25), the reference may be, as in line 3 of stanza 27, to the wealth of Atli's father, Buthli. ~<Hlothver~>: the northern form of the Frankish name Chlodowech (Ludwig), but who this Hlothver was, beyond the fact that he was evidently a Frankish king, is uncertain. If Atli is speaking, he is presumably a Frankish ruler whose land Atli and his Huns have conquered.\n\n27. Cf. note on stanza 25 as to the probable speaker.\n\n28. In stanzas 28-32 the dialogue, in alternate stanzas, is clearly between Guthrun and her mother, Grimhild, though the manuscript does not indicate the speakers.]",

This stanza presents a strong argument for transposing the description of the draught of forgetfulness (stanzas 22-24 and lines 1-2 of stanza 25) to follow stanza 33. ~<Raven~>, etc.: the original is somewhat obscure, and the line may refer simply to the \"corpse-eating raven.\" 32. In the manuscript this stanza is immediately followed by the two lines which here, following Bugge's suggestion, appear]",

If stanza 35 really belongs here, it continues the prophesy to the effect that Guthrun will have no rest till she has avenged her brothers' death.\n\n33. Very likely the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 4 as beginning a new stanza. On the other band, lines 3 and 5 may be interpolations. ~<Vinbjorg~> and ~<Valbjorg~>: apparently imaginary place-names.\n\n34. ~<The kings~>: presumably Gunnar and Hogni. ~<My sons~>: regarding Guthrun's slaying of her two sons by Atli, Erp and Eitil, cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>, note.\n\n35. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 32. The loss of two lines, to the effect that \"Ill was that marriage for my brothers, and ill for Atli himself,\" and the transposition of the remaining two lines to this point, are indicated in a number of editions. ~<The~> ~<warrior~>, etc.: Atli, whom Guthrun kills.]",

Line 5, which the manuscript marks as be ginning a stanza, is probably spurious.\n\n37. After these two lines there appears to be a considerable gap, the lost stanzas giving Guthrun's story of the slaying of her brothers. It is possible that stanzas 38-45 came originally from another poem, dealing with Atli's dream, and were here substituted for the original conclusion of Guthrun's lament. Many editions combine stanzas 37 and 38, or combine stanza 38 (the manuscript marks line I as beginning a stanza) with lines 1-2 of stanza 39.\n\n39. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. The manuscript and most editions do not indicate the speakers in this and the following stanzas.]",

				"~<Guthrun spake:~>\n40. \"Fire a dream | of steel shall follow\nAnd willful pride | one of woman's wrath;\nA baneful sore | I shall burn from thee,\nAnd tend and heal thee, | though hated thou am\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n41. \"Of plants I dreamed, | in the garden drooping,\nThat fain would I have | full high to grow;\nPlucked by the roots, | and red with blood,\nThey brought them hither, | and bade me eat.\n\n42. \"I dreamed my hawks | from my hand had flown,\nEager for food, | to an evil house;\nI dreamed their hearts | with honey I ate,\nSoaked in blood, | and heavy my sorrow.\n\n43. \"Hounds I dreamed | from my hand I loosed,\nLoud in hunger | and pain they howled;\nTheir flesh methought | was eagles' food,\nAnd their bodies now | I needs must eat.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n44. \"Men shall soon | of sacrifice speak,\n\n[40. Guthrun, somewhat obscurely, interprets Atli's first dream (stanza 39) to mean that she will cure him of an abscess by cauterizing it. Her interpretation is, of course, intended merely to blind him to her purpose.\n\n41. In stanzas 41-43 Atli's dreams forecast the death of his two sons, whose flesh Guthrun gives him to eat (cf. ~<Atlakvitha~>, 39, and ~<Atlamol~>, 78).\n\n44. This stanza is evidently Guthrun's intentionally cryptic]",

				"And off the heads | of beasts shall hew\nDie they shall | ere day has dawned,\nA few nights hence, | and the folk shall have them.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n45. \"On my bed I sank, | nor slumber sought,\nWeary with woe,-- | full well I remember.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n[interpretation of Atli's dreams, but the meaning of the original is more than doubtful. The word here rendered \"sacrifice\" may mean \"sea-catch,\" and the one rendered \"beasts\" may mean \"whales.\" None of the attempted emendations have rendered the stanza really intelligible, but it appears to mean that Atli will soon make a sacrifice of beasts at night, and give their bodies to the people. Guthrun of course has in mind the slaying of his two sons.\n\n45. With these two lines the poem abruptly ends; some editors assign the speech to Atli (I think rightly), others to Guthrun. Ettmüller combines the lines with stanza 38. Whether stanzas 38-45 originally belonged to Guthrun's lament, or were interpolated here in place of the lost conclusion of that poem from another one dealing with Atli's dreams (cf. note on stanza 37), it is clear that the end has been lost.]"

				"~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>\n\n~<The Third Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe short ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, entitled in the manuscript simply Guthrunarkvitha, but so numbered in most editions to distinguish it from the first and second Guthrun lays, appears only in the ~<Codex Regius~>. It is neither quoted nor paraphrased in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, the compilers of which appear not to have known the story with which it deals. The poem as we have it is evidently complete and free from serious interpolations. It can safely be dated from the first half of the eleventh century, for the ordeal by boiling water, with which it is chiefly concerned, was first introduced into Norway by St. Olaf, who died in 1030, and the poem speaks of it in stanza 7 as still of foreign origin.\n\nThe material for the poem evidently came from North Germany, but there is little indication that the poet was working on the basis of a narrative legend already fully formed. The story of the wife accused of faithlessness who proves her innocence by the test of boiling water had long been current in Germany, as elsewhere, and had attached itself to various women of legendary fame, but not except in this poem, so far as we can judge, to Guthrun (Kriemhild). The introduction of Thjothrek (Theoderich, Dietrich, Thithrek) is another indication of relative lateness, for the legends of Theoderich do not appear to have reached the North materially before the year 1000. On the anachronism of bringing Thjothrek to Atli's court cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory prose, note, in which the development of the Theoderich tradition in its relation to that of Atli is briefly outlined.\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> is, then, little more than a dramatic German story made into a narrative lay by a Norse poet, with the names of Guthrun, Atli, Thjothrek, and Herkja incorporated for the sake of greater effectiveness. Its story probably nowhere formed a part of the living tradition of Sigurth and Atli, but the poem has so little distinctively Norse coloring that it may Possibly have been based on a story or even a poem which its composer heard in Germany or from the lips of a German narrator.",

				"__________________\n\nHerkja was the name of a serving-woman of Atli's; she had been his concubine. She told Atli that she had seen Thjothrek and Guthrun both together. Atli was greatly angered thereby. Then Guthrun said:\n\n1. \"What thy sorrow, Atli, | Buthli's son?\nIs thy heart heavy-laden? | Why laughest thou never?\nIt would better befit | the warrior far\nTo speak with men, | and me to look on.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n2. \"It troubles me, Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,\nWhat Herkja here | in the hall hath told me,\nThat thou in the bed | with Thjothrek liest,\nBeneath the linen | in lovers' guise.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n3. \"This shall I | with oaths now swear,\nSwear by the sacred | stone so white,\nThat nought was there | with Thjothmar's son\nThat man or woman | may not know.\n\n[~<Prose~>. The annotator derived all the material for this note from the poem itself, except for the reference to Herkja as Atli's former concubine. ~<Herkja~>: the historical Kreka and the Helche of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, who there appears as Etzel's (Attila's) first wife. ~<Thjothrek~>: cf. Introductory Note.\n\n2. The manuscript omits the names of the speakers through out.\n\n3. ~<Holy stone~>: just what this refers to is uncertain; it may be identical with the \"ice-cold stone of Uth\" mentioned in an oath in ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>, 29. ~<Thjothmar's son~>: the manuscript has simply \"Thjothmar.\" Some editions change it as]",

				"4. \"Nor ever once | did my arms embrace\nThe hero brave, | the leader of hosts;\nIn another manner | our meeting was,\nWhen our sorrows we | in secret told.\n\n5. \"With thirty warriors | Thjothrek came,\nNor of all his men | doth one remain;\nThou hast murdered my brothers | and mail-clad men,\nThou hast murdered all | the men of my race.\n\n6. \"Gunnar comes not, | Hogni I greet not,\nNo longer I see | my brothers loved;\nMy sorrow would Hogni | avenge with the sword,\nNow myself for my woes | I shall payment win.\n\n7. \"Summon Saxi, | the southrons' king,\nFor be the boiling | kettle can hallow.\"\n\n[here, some assume that Thjothmar is another name or an error for Thjothrek, and Finnur Jonsson not only retains Thjothmar here but changes Thjothrek to Thjothmar in stanza 5 to conform to it.\n\n5. Regarding the death of Thjothrek's men cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory prose, note. It was on these stanzas of ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> that the annotator based his introduction to ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>. The manuscript repeats the \"thirty\" in line 2, in defiance of metrical requirements.\n\n6. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 7; many editions have made the transposition.\n\n7. Who Saxi may be is not clear, but the stanza clearly points to the time when the ordeal by boiling water was still regarded as a foreign institution, and when a southern king (i. e., a Christian from some earlier-converted region) was necessary]",

				"Seven hundred | there were in the hall,\nEre the queen her hand | in the kettle thrust.\n\n8.

The ordeal by boiling water followed closely the introduction of Christianity, which took place around the year 1000. Some editions make two stanzas out of stanza 7, and Müllenhoff contends that lines 1-2 do not constitute part of Guthrun's speech.\n\n10. The word \"requited\" in line 4 is omitted in the manuscript, but it is clear that some such word was intended. The punishment of casting a culprit into a bog to be drowned was particularly reserved for women, and is not infrequently mentioned in the sagas.]"

			"name", "Atlakvitha En Grönlenzka",
			"text", {
				"~<Atlakvitha En Grönlenzka~>\n\n~<The Greenland Lay of Atli~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThere are two Atli poems in the ~<Codex Regius~>, the ~<Atlakvitha~> (Lay of Atli) and the ~<Atlamol~> (Ballad of Atli). The poems are not preserved or quoted in any other old manuscript, but they were extensively used by the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~>. In the manuscript superscription to each of these poems appears the word \"Greenland,\" which has given rise to a large amount of argument. The scribe was by no means infallible, and in this case his statement proves no more than that in the period round 1300 there was a tradition that these two poems originated in the Greenland settlement.\n\nThe two Atli poems deal with substantially the same material: the visit of the sons of Gjuki to Atli's court, their deaths, and the subsequent revenge of their sister, Guthrun, Atli's wife, on her husband. The shorter of the two, the ~<Atlakvitha~>, tells the story with little elaboration; the ~<Atlamol~>, with about the same narrative basis, adds many details, some of them apparently of the poet's invention, and with a romantic, not to say sentimental, quality quite lacking in the ~<Atlakvitha~>. Both poems are sharply distinguished from the rest of the collection by their metrical form, which is the Malahattr (used irregularly also in the ~<Harbarthsljoth~>), employed consistently and smoothly in the ~<Atlamol~>, and with a considerable mixture of what appear to be Fornyrthislag lines (cf. Introduction) in the ~<Atlakvitha~>.\n\nIt is altogether probable that both poems belong to the eleventh century, the shorter ~<Atlakvitha~> being generally dated from the first quarter thereof, and the longer ~<Atlamol~> some fifty years or more later. In each case the poet was apparently a Christian; in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 82) Guthrun expresses her readiness to die and \"go into another light,\" and in the ~<Atlakvitha~> there is frequent use of mythological names (~<e.g.~>, Valhall, Hlithskjolf) with an evident lack of understanding of their relation to the older gods. These facts fit the theory of a Greenland origin exceedingly well, for the Greenland settlement grew rapidly after the first explorations of Eirik the Red, which were in 982-985, and its most flourishing period was in the eleventh century. The internal evidence, particularly in the case of the ~<Atlamol~>, points",

				"likewise to an origin remote from Iceland, Norway, and the \"Western Isles\"; and the two poems are sufficiently alike so that, despite the efforts of Finnur Jonsson and others to separate them, assigning one to Greenland and the other to Norway or else where, it seems probable that the manuscript statement is correct in both instances, and that the two Atli poems did actually originate in Greenland. An interesting account of this Greenland settlement is given in William Hovgaard's ~<Voyages of the Norsemen to America~>, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1914, and an extraordinarily vivid picture of the sufferings of the early settlers appears in Maurice Hewlett's ~<Thorgils~>, taken from the ~<Floamannasaga~>.\n\nFrom the standpoint of narrative material there is little that is distinctively Norse in either the ~<Atlakvitha~> or the ~<Atlamol~>. The story is the one outlined in the prose ~<Drap Niflunga~> (largely based on these two poems), representing almost exclusively the southern blending of the Attila and Burgundian legends (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>). In the ~<Atlakvitha~>, indeed, the word \"Burgundians\" is actually used. Brynhild is not mentioned in either poem; Sigurth's name appears but once, in the ~<Atlamol~>. Thus the material goes directly back to its South-Germanic origins, with little of the Northern making-over which resulted in such extensive changes in most parts of the Sigurth story. The general atmosphere, on the other hand, particularly in the ~<Atlamol~>, is essentially Norse.\n\nAs has been said, the ~<Atlakvitha~> is metrically in a chaotic state, the normal Malahattr lines being frequently interspersed with lines and even stanzas which apparently are of the older Fornyrthislag type. How much of this confusion is due to faulty transmission is uncertain, but it has been suggested that the composer of the ~<Atlakvitha~> made over in Malahattr an older Atli poem in ~<Fornyrthislag~>, and this suggestion has much to recommend it. That he worked on the basis of an older poem is, indeed, almost certain, for in oral prose tradition a far larger number of distinctively Norse traits would unquestionably have crept in than are found in the material of the ~<Atlakvitha~>. As for the ~<Atlamol~>, here again the poet seems to have used an older poem as his basis, possibly the ~<Atlakvitha~> itself, although in that case he must have had other material as well, for there are frequent divergences in such matters as proper names. The translation of the ~<Atlakvitha~> is rendered peculiarly difficult ",

				"by the irregularity of the metre, by the evident faultiness of the transmission, and above all by the exceptionally large number of words found nowhere else in Old Norse, involving much guesswork as to their meanings. The notes do not attempt to indicate all the varying suggestions made by editors and commentators as to the reconstruction of defective stanzas and the probable meanings of obscure passages; in cases which are purely or largely guesswork the notes merely point out the uncertainty without cataloguing the proposed solutions.\n\n__________________\n\nGuthrun, Gjuki's daughter, avenged her brothers, as has become well known. She slew first Atli's sons, and thereafter she slew Atli, and burned the hall with his whole company. Concerning this was the following poem made:\n\n1. Atli sent | of old to Gunnar\nA keen-witted rider, | Knefröth did men call him;\nTo Gjuki's home came he | and to Gunnar's dwelling,\nWith benches round the hearth, | and to the beer so sweet.\n\n[~<Prose~>. On the marriage of Guthrun to Atli at the instigation of her brothers, Gunnar and Hogni, and on the slaying of Atli and his two sons, Erp and Eitil, cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~> and note.\n\n1. Line 1 apparently is in Fornyrthislag. ~<Knefröth~> (the name is spelt in various ways, and its meaning is uncertain): in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) there are two messengers, one named Vingi and the other unnamed; the annotator combines the two versions in the ~<Drap Niflunga~>. ~<Benches~>, etc.: the adjective rendered \"round the hearth,\" which etymologically it ought to mean, is made obscure by its application to \"helmets\" in stanzas 3 and 17.]",

				"2. Then the followers, hiding | their falseness, all drank\nTheir wine in the war-hall, | of the Huns' wrath wary;\nAnd Knefröth spake loudly, | his words were crafty,\nThe hero from the south, | on the high bench sitting:\n\n3. \"Now Atli has sent me | his errand to ride,\nOn my bit-champing steed | through Myrkwood the secret,\nTo bid You, Gunnar, | to his benches to come,\nWith helms round the hearth, | and Atli's home seek.\n\n4. \"Shields shall ye choose there, | and shafts made of ash-wood,\nGold-adorned helmets, | and slaves out of Hunland,\n\n[2. ~<Falseness~>: i.e., Gunnar's followers concealed their fear and hatred of the Huns at the feast; but the word may mean \"fear of treachery.\" ~<War-hall~>: the word used is \"Valhall,\" the name of Othin's hall of slain warriors.\n\n3. ~<Myrkwood the secret~> (the adjective is literally \"unknown\") the which divided Atli's realm from that of the Gjukungs; cf. ~<Oddrunargratr~>, 23 and note. ~<Around the hearth~>: the adjective is the same one which is applied to \"benches\" in stanza 1 (cf. note); it may be an error here, or it may possibly have the force of \"of your followers,\" i.e., Gunnar is to arm the men of his household (those who are round his hearth) for the journey.\n\n4. ~<Slaves~>, etc.: some editions have \"swords in plenty.\" ~<Scarlet~>: the word apparently means \"slaughter-red,\" \"blood-red,\" but it may mean something entirely different.]",

				"Silver-gilt saddle-cloths, | shirts of bright scarlet,\nWith lances and spears too, | and bit-champing steeds.\n\n5. \"The field shall be given you | of wide Gnitaheith,\nWith loud-ringing lances, | and stems gold-o'er-laid,\nTreasures full huge, | and the home of Danp,\nAnd the mighty forest | that Myrkwood is called.\"\n\n6. His head turned Gunnar, | and to Hogni he said:\n\"What thy counsel, young hero, | when such things we hear?\nNo gold do I know | on Gnitaheith lying\nSo fair that other | its equal we have not.\n\n7. \"We have seven halls, | each of swords is full,\n\n[5. ~<Gnitaheith~>: here the dragon Fafnir had his lair (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 11). Sigurth doubtless owned it after Fafnir's death, and the Gjukungs after they had killed Sigurth. Possibly they had given it to Atli in recompense for the death of his sister, Brynhild, and he now offered to restore it to them, or--as seems more likely--the poet was not very clear about its ownership himself. ~<Stems~>: i.e., the gilded stems of ships, carved like dragons,--an evident northern touch, if the word is correct, which is by no means certain . ~<Danp~>: this name was early applied to a mythical Danish king (cf. ~<Rigsthula~>, 49 and note) but it may have been fabricated by error out of the word \"DanparstaÞir\" (the phrase here used is \"staÞi Danpar\"), used in the ~<Hervararsaga~> of a field of battle between the Goths and the Huns, and quite possibly referring to the region of the Dnieper. The name seems to have clung to the Atli tradition long after it had lost all definite significance. ~<Myrkwood~>: cf. note on stanza 3.]",

Not eager were his comrades, | nor the men of his kin,\n\n[7. The stanza is clearly in bad shape; the manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza. In line 5 the manuscript has \"and shield\" after \"helm.\" ~<Kjar~>: Gering ingeniously identifies this Kjar with Kjar the father of Olrun, mentioned in the ~<Völundarkvitha~>, introductory prose and stanza 2, on the basis of a genealogy in the ~<Flateyjarbok~>, in which Authi, the grand father of Kjar (by no means certainly the same man) and Buthli, father of Atli, are mentioned as making a raiding voyage together. This identification, however, rests on slight evidence.\n\n8. The manuscript does not name the speaker. One editor gives the first sentence to Gunnar. ~<She~>, etc.: Guthrun, seeking to warn her brothers of Atli's treachery, sends them a ring with a wolf's hair as a sign of danger; in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) she sends a message written in runes; cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>. ~<Heath-dweller~>: wolf.]",

				"The wise nor the wary, | nor the warriors bold.\nBut Gunnar spake forth | as befitted a king,\nNoble in the beer-hall, | and bitter his scorn:\n\n10. \"Stand forth now, Fjornir! | and hither on the floor\nThe beakers all golden | shalt thou bring to the warriors.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n11. \"The wolves then shall rule | the wealth of the Niflungs,\nWolves aged and grey-hued, | if Gunnar is lost,\nAnd black-coated bears | with rending teeth bite,\nAnd make glad the dogs, | if Gunnar returns not.\"\n\n[9. In line 1 the manuscript has \"His comrades did not urge Gunnar,\" but the name, involving a metrical error, seems to have been inserted through a scribal blunder.\n\n10. The manuscript indicates no lacuna, but probably two lines have dropped out, for the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase runs: \"Give us to drink in great cups, for it may well be that this shall be our last feast.\" ~<Fjornir~>: Gunnar's cup-bearer.\n\n11. Bugge thinks this stanza is spoken by Gunnar's terrified followers; Grundtvig assigns it to Hogni. Apparently, however, Gunnar means that if he and his men are not valiant enough to make the journey and return safely, it matters little what may happen to them. ~<Niflungs~>: regarding the application of this name to Gunnar's Burgundians cf. ~<Brot~>, 17 and note. ~<Bears~>: these \"black\" bears have been used as arguments against the Greenland origin of the poem. ~<And make glad the dogs~>: i.e., by giving them corpses to eat, but the phrase in the original is more than doubtful.]",

Some editions in line 2 read \"home of the Niflungs\" instead of \"their home,\" and others \"home of the Huns,\" the manuscript reading being \"home of the men.\" ~<Heir~>: the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 28) names two sons of Hogni, Snævar and Solar, both of whom make the journey with their father and are killed. The ~<Volsungasaga~>, combining the two versions, says that Snævar and Solar went with their father, and implies that it was a third and still younger son who said: \"Farewell, and have a good time\" (thus literally).\n\n11. ~<Myrkwood~>: cf. stanza 3 and note; the journey is here made by land, whereas in the ~<Atlamol~> it is made partly by boat; cf. ~<Atlamol~>, 34 and note. ~<Whip-fearers~>: horses, but there is some uncertainty as to the word.\n\n13. In line 1 the manuscript has \"land\" instead of \"halls,\" which involves a metrical error. ~<Watch-towers~>: the word used is identical with the name of Othin's watch-tower, Hlithskjolf (cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose). ~<Buthli~>: the manuscript has \"Bikki,\" which has led some editors to transfer this stanza to]",

Line 4 is apparently in Fornyrthislag.\n\n15. Line 1 in the manuscript is apparently incorrectly copied, and some editions omit \"Mid weapons and lances\" and assume a gap in either line 1 or line 3.\n\n17.

Roman writers refer to the warrior-women among the early Germanic tribes, and the tradition, closely allied to that of the Valkyries, attached itself readily to the ferocious Huns. ~<Den of snakes~>: concerning the manner of Gunnar's death cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>.\n\n18. The manuscript indicates no lacuna and does not name the speaker; perhaps a line similar to line 1 of stanza 24 (or 26) should be inserted here. ~<Rhine~>: Gunnar's Burgundian home is here clearly localized.

This is the only place in the poems in which the name \"Burgundian\" appears; that the poet had no very clear conception of its meaning is indicated by the fact that in stanza 21 he calls Gunnar \"king of the Goths.\"\n\n20. Apparently a Fornyrthislag stanza, though most editions have attempted to expand the lines into Malahattr. The exploits of Hogni (Hagene), with the names of many of his victims, are told in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>. ~<The fire~>: in the Nibelungenlied Kriemhild has the hall set on fire, and the Burgundians fight amid the flames. Line 4 is clearly defective, and some editors regard the name \"Gunnar\" as all that is left of the first two lines of stanza 21.\n\n21. Again apparently the remains of a Fornyrthislag stanza. Editors have attempted various combinations of the lines. ~<Gold~>: presumably Sigurth's treasure.\n\n22.

He did not, of course, intend that the heart should be cut from the living Hogni.\n\n23. Most editions assume a gap (lines 1-2, 2-3 or 3-4). ~<Hjalli~>: Atli's cook, killed to deceive Gunnar, as Atli hoped to wring the secret of the hoard from Hogni if Gunnar remained silent. In the ~<Atlamol~> (stanzas 59-60) Atli's men prepare to kill Hjalli, but he is spared at Hogni's intercession.\n\n25. ~<Helm-hammerer~> (literally \"helmet-smith\"): warrior, i.e., Hogni.

Apparently all that is left of a full stanza. The manuscript does not name Atli as the speaker, and Grundtvig inserts: \"Then Atli called, | the king of the Huns,\" as a first line. Some editors combine this line with the two lines of stanza 33. ~<Wagon~>: in ~<Brot~>, 16, Gunnar is led to his death in the serpents' den on horseback, not in a wagon.\n\n31. The stanza in the original is hopelessly confused. ~<Glaum~>: this horse of Atli's is mentioned by name elsewhere. ~<Long-maned~>: uncertain. The manuscript indicates no gap, but something has evidently been lost. ~<Gods of slaughter~>: perhaps the phrase, usually applied to Othin and the other gods, is here used simply to mean \"heroes,\" i.e., Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. Line 4 suggests Guthrun's tearlessness after Sigurth's death (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 11)]",

Nothing is known of his ring.\n\n33. Apparently the remains of a Fornyrthislag stanza. Some editors combine the two lines with the line here indicated as stanza 30. ~<Champer of bits~>: horse. The manuscript indicates no gap.\n\n54. Six Fornyrthislag lines which editors have tried to reconstruct in all sorts of ways.

In ~<Atlamol~>, 62, Gunnar plays the harp with his feet, his hands being bound, and some editors change hand in line 4 to \"foot.\" Lines 5-6 may be interpolated, or, as Bugge maintains, lines 1-4 may have been expanded out of two lines.]",

				"~<Atlamol En Grönlenzku~>\n\n~<The Greenland Ballad of Atli~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nMany of the chief facts regarding the ~<Atlamol~>, which follows the ~<Atlakvitha~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, are outlined in the introductory note to the earlier Atli lay. That the superscription in the manuscript is correct, and that the poem was actually composed in Greenland, is generally accepted; the specific reference to polar bears (stanza 17), and the general color of the entire poem make this origin exceedingly likely. Most critics, again, agree in dating the poem nearer 1100 than 1050. As to its state of preservation there is some dispute, but, barring one or two possible gaps of some importance, and the usual number of passages in which the interpolation or omission of one or two lines may be suspected, the ~<Atlamol~> has clearly come down to us in fairly good shape.\n\nThroughout the poem the epic quality of the story itself is overshadowed by the romantically sentimental tendencies of the poet, and by his desire to adapt the narrative to the understanding of his fellow-Greenlanders. The substance of the poem is the same as that of the ~<Atlakvitha~>; it tells of Atli's message to the sons of Gjuki, their journey to Atli's home, the slaying of Hogni and Gunnar, Guthrun's bitterness over the death of her brothers, and her bloody revenge on Atli. Thus in its bare out line the ~<Atlamol~> represents simply the Frankish blending of the legends of the slaughter of the Burgundians and the death of Attila (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, introductory note). But here the resemblance ends. The poet has added characters, apparently of his own creation, for the sake of episodes which would appeal to both the men and the women of the Greenland settlement. Sea voyages take the place of journeys by land; Atli is reproached, not for cowardice in battle, but for weakness at the Thing or great council. The additions made by the poet are responsible for the ~<Atlamol's~> being the longest of all the heroic poems in the Eddic collection, and they give it a kind of emotional vivid ness, but it has little of the compressed intensity of the older poems. Its greatest interest lies in its demonstration of the manner in which a story brought to the North from the South Germanic lands could be adapted to the understanding and tastes of its",

				"eleventh century hearers without any material change of the basic narrative.\n\nIn what form or forms the story of the Gjukungs and Atli reached the Greenland poet cannot be determined, but it seems likely that he was familiar with older poems on the subject, and possibly with the ~<Atlakvitha~> itself. That the details which are peculiar to the ~<Atlamol~>, such as the figures of Kostbera and Glaumvor, existed in earlier tradition seems doubtful, but the son of Hogni, who aids Guthrun in the slaying of Atli, appears, though under another name, in other late versions of the story, and it is impossible to say just how much the poet relied on his own imagination and how far he found suggestions and hints in the prose or verse stories of Atli with which he was familiar.\n\nThe poem is in Malahattr (cf. Introduction) throughout, the verse being far more regular than in the ~<Atlakvitha~>. The compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> evidently knew it in very much the form in which we now have it, for in the main it is paraphrased with great fidelity.\n\n1. There are many who know | how of old did men\nIn counsel gather; | little good did they get;\nIn secret they plotted, | it was sore for them later,\nAnd for Gjuki's sons, | whose trust they deceived.\n\n2. Fate grew for the princes, | to death they were given;\nIll counsel was Atli's, | though keenness he had;\n\n[1. ~<Men~>: Atli and his advisers, with whom he planned the death of the sons of ~<Gjuki~>, Gunnar and Hogni. The poet's reference to the story as well known explains the abruptness of his introduction, without the mention of Atli's name, and his reference to Guthrun in stanza 3 simply as \"the woman\" (\"husfreyja,\" goddess of the house).\n\n2. ~<Princes~>: Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. ~<Bulwark~>: Atli's slaying]",

				"He felled his staunch bulwark, | his own sorrow fashioned,\nSoon a message he sent | that his kinsmen should seek him.\n\n3.

Runes did she fashion, | but false Vingi made them,\nThe speeder of hatred, | ere to give them he sought;\nThen soon fared the warriors | whom Atli had sent,\nAnd to Limafjord came, | to the home of the kings.\n\n5.

The name was derived from \"Eylimafjorþ,\" i.e., Eylimi's fjord. The poet may really have thought that the kingdom of the Burgundians was in Jutland, or he may simply have taken a well-known name for the sake of vividness.]",

It is altogether probable that a stanza has been lost between stanzas 6 and 7, in which Gunnar is first invited, and replies doubtfully. ~<Made promise~>: many editions emend the text to read \"promised the journey.\" The text of line 4 is obscure; the manuscript reads \"nitti\" (\"refused\"), which many editors have changed to \"hlitti,\" which means exactly the opposite. 8.

Some editions combine this stanza with lines 1-2 of stanza 11. The manuscript indicates no gap. Grundtvig adds (line 2) \"But sleep to the woman | so wise came little.\"\n\n11.

In any case, the lost lines cannot materially have altered the meaning.\n\n15. ~<Saw I~>: the manuscript here, as also in stanzas 16, 18, 2r, 22, and 24, has \"methought,\" which involves a metrical error.

Two lines may have been lost after line 2, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase gives no clue. ~<Ice-bear~>: polar bears, common in Greenland, are very rarely found in Iceland, and never in Norway, a fact which substantiates the manuscript's reference to Greenland as the home of the poem.\n\n18. The manuscript indicates no gap, but most editors assume the loss of a line after line 1 or 2; Grundtvig adds, after line 1: \"Black were his feathers, | with blood was he covered.\" ~<Atli's spirit~>: the poet's folk-lore seems here a bit weak. Presumably he means such a female following-spirit (\"fylgja\") as appears in ~<Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar~>, prose following stanza 34 (cf. note thereon), but the word he uses, \"hamr\" (masculine) means \"skin,\" \"shape.\" He may, however, imply that Atli had assumed the shape of an eagle for this occasion.\n\n19.

Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2. Possibly the concluding phrase of line 2 should be \"bloody spears,\" as in the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase.\n\n24.

Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza.\n\n27. ~<Five~>: Gunnar, Hogni, and the three mentioned in Stanza 28.\n\n28.

Hild for Brynhild (~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, 6). The manuscript indicates no gap; Grundtvig inserts (line 2): \"And clear was her cry to her kinsmen dear.\"\n\n32. Hogni's method of cheering his wife and sister-in-law is somewhat unusual, for the meaning of lines 3-4 is that good wishes and blessings are of little use in warding off danger.\n\n33. Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2; Grundtvig supplies: \"Then weeping did | Glaumvor go to her rest-bed, / And sadly did Bera | her spinning wheel seek.\"\n\n34. ~<Keel~>, etc.: in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, and presumably in the older German tradition, Hagene breaks his oar steering the Burgundians across the Danube (stanza 1564), and, after all have landed, splinters the boat (stanza 1581) in order that there may be no retreating. The poet here seems to have confused the story,]",

				"The oar-loops were burst, | the thole-pins, were broken,\nNor the ship made they fast | ere from her they fared.\n\n35. Not long was it after-- | the end must I tell--\nThat the home they beheld | that Buthli once had;\nLoud the gates resounded | when Hogni smote them;\nVingi spake then a word | that were better unsaid:\n\n36. \"Go ye far from the house, | for false is its entrance,\nSoon shall I burn you, | ye are swiftly smitten;\nI bade ye come fairly, | but falseness was under,\nNow bide ye afar | while your gallows I fashion.\"\n\n37. Then Hogni made answer, | his heart yielded little,\n\n[connecting the breaking of the ship's keel with the violence of the rowing, but echoing the older legend in the last line, wherein the ship is allowed to drift away after the, travellers have landed. ~<Oar-loops~>: the thongs by which the oars in a Norse boat were made fast to the ~<thole-pins~>, the combination taking the place of the modern oarlock.\n\n35. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and many editions combine it with stanza 36, some of them assuming the loss of a line from stanza 35. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase the second half of line 4 is made a part of Vingi's speech: \"Better had ye left this undone.\"\n\n36. Cf. note on preceding stanza; the manuscript does not indicate line I as beginning a stanza. Line 3 may be spurious.\n\n37. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase the second half of line 1 and the first half of line 2 are included in Hogni's speech.]",

				"And nought did he fear | that his fate held in store:\n\"Seek not to affright us, | thou shalt seldom succeed;\nIf thy words are more, | then the worse grows thy fate.\"\n\n38. Then Vingi did they smite, | and they sent him to hell,\nWith their axes they clove him | while the death rattle came.\n\n39.

Possibly two lines have been lost after line 2.\n\n39. It is probable that a considerable passage has been lost between stanzas 39 and 40, for the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase includes a dialogue at this point. The manuscript indicates no gap, and most editions combine stanzas 39 and 40 as a single stanza. The prose passage, indicating the substance of what, if any thing, is lost, runs as follows: \"'Be welcome among us, and give me that store of gold which is ours by right, the gold that Sigurth had, and that now belongs to Guthrun.' Gunnar said: 'Never shalt thou get that gold, and men of might shalt thou find here, ere we give up our lives, if it is battle thou dost offer us; in truth it seems that thou hast prepared this feast in kingly fashion,]",

				"\"Long since did we plan | how soon we might slay you.\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n41. \"Little it matters | if long ye have planned it;\nFor unarmed do ye wait, | and one have we felled,\nWe smote him to hell, | of your host was he once.\"\n\n42.

In the house came the word | how the heroes with out\n\n[and with little grudging toward eagle and wolf.\"' The demand for the treasure likewise appears in the Nibelungenlied.\n\n40. These two lines, which most editions combine with stanza 39, may be the first or last two of a four-line stanza. The ~<Volsungasaga~> gives Atli's speech very much as it appears here.\n\n41. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker; Grundtvig adds as a first line: \"Then Hogni laughed loud where the slain Vingi lay.\" Many editors assume the loss of a line somewhere in the stanza. ~<Unarmed~>: Hogni does not see Atli's armed followers, who are on the other side of the courtyard (stanza 39). One: Vingi.\n\n42. Most editors assume the loss of one line, after either line 1 or line 3.\n\n45. The manuscript reading of lines 1-2, involving a metrical error, is: \"In the house came the word | of the warring without, / Loud in front of the hall | they heard a thrall shouting.\" Some editors assume a gap of two lines after line]",

				"Fought in front of the hall; | they heard a thrall tell it;\nGrim then was Guthrun, | the grief when she heard,\nWith necklaces fair, | and she flung them all from her,\n(The silver she hurled | so the rings burst asunder.)\n\n44. Then out did she go, | she flung open the doors,\nAll fearless she went, | and the guests did she welcome;\nTo the Niflungs she went-- | her last greeting it was,--\nIn her speech truth was clear, | and much would she speak.\n\n45. \"For your safety I sought | that at home ye should stay;\nNone escapes his fate, | so ye hither must fare.\"\nFull wisely she spake, | if yet peace they might win,\n\n[2, the missing passage giving the words of the thrall. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editions make a separate stanza of lines 3-5, same of them assuming the loss of a line after line 3. With the stanza as here given, line 5 may well be spurious.\n\n44. ~<Niflungs~>: regarding the application of this term to the Burgundians cf. ~<Atlakvitha~>, 11, and ~<Brot~>, 17, and notes. The manuscript here spells the name with an initial N, as elsewhere, but in stanza 83 the son of Hogni appears with the name \"Hniflung.\" In consequence, some editors change the form in this stanza to \"Hniflungs,\" while others omit the initial H in both cases. I have followed the manuscript, though admittedly its spelling is illogical.]",

				"But to nought would they hearken, | and \"No\" said they all.\n\n46. Then the high-born one saw | that hard was their battle,\nIn fierceness of heart | she flung off her mantle;\nHer naked sword grasped she | her kin's lives to guard,\nNot gentle her hands | in the hewing of battle.\n\n47. Then the daughter of Gjuki | two warriors smote down,\nAtli's brother she slew, | and forth then they bore him;\n(So fiercely she fought | that his feet she clove off;)\nAnother she smote | so that never he stood,\nTo hell did she send him,-- | her hands trembled never.\n\n[46. The warlike deeds of Guthrun represent an odd transformation of the German tradition. Kriemhild, although she did no actual fighting in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, was famed from early times for her cruelty and fierceness of heart, and this seems to have inspired the poet of the ~<Atlamol~> to make his Guthrun into a warrior outdoing Brynhild herself. Kriemhild's ferocity of course, was directed against Gunther and especially Hagene, for whose slaying she rather than Etzel was responsible; here, on the other hand, Guthrun's is devoted to the defense of her brothers.\n\n47. Line 3 is very likely an interpolation. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5. ~<Atli's brother~>: doubtless a reminiscence of the early tradition represented in the ~<Nibelungenlied~> by the slaying of Etzel's brother, Blœdelin (the historical Bleda), by Dancwart.]",

				"48. Full wide was the fame | of the battle they fought,\n'Twas the greatest of deeds | of the sons of Gjuki;\nMen say that the Niflungs, | while themselves they were living,\nWith their swords fought mightily, | mail-coats they sundered,\nAnd helms did they hew, | as their hearts were fearless.\n\n49. All the morning they fought | until midday shone,\n(All the dusk as well | and the dawning of day,)\nWhen the battle was ended, | the field flowed with blood;\nEre they fell, eighteen | of their foemen were slain,\nBy the two sons of Bera | and her brother as well.\n\n50. Then the warrior spake, | and wild was his anger:\n\"This is evil to see, | and thy doing is all;\n\n[48. Line 3 may well be spurious, for it implies that Gunnar and Hogni were killed in battle, whereas they were taken prisoners. Some editors, in an effort to smooth out the inconsistency, change \"themselves\" in this line to \"sound.\" Line 5 has also been questioned as possibly interpolated. ~<Niflungs~>: on the spelling of this name in the manuscript and the various editions cf. note on stanza 44.\n\n49. Line 2 is probably an interpolation, and the original apparently lacks a word. There is some obscurity as to the exact meaning of lines 4-5. ~<The two sons of Bera~>: Snævar and Solar; ~<her brother~> is Orkning; cf. stanza 28.\n\n50. ~<The warrior~>: Atli. ~<Thirty~>: perhaps an echo of the \"thirty warriors\" of Thjothrek (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, 5). Subtracting the eighteen killed by Snævar, Solar and Orkning (stanza 49), and Vingi, killed by the whole company (stanza]",

				"Once we were thirty, | we thanes, keen for battle,\nNow eleven are left, | and great is our lack.\n\n51. \"There were five of us brothers | when Buthli we lost,\nNow Hel has the half, | and two smitten lie here;\nA great kinship had I,-- | the truth may I hide not,--\nFrom a wife bringing slaughter | small joy could I win.\n\n52. We lay seldom together | since to me thou wast given,\nNow my kin all are gone, | of my gold am I robbed;\nNay, and worst, thou didst send | my sister to hell.\"\n\n[38), we have eleven left, as Atli says, but this does not allow much for the exploits of Gunnar and Hogni, who, by this reckoning, seem to have killed nobody. The explanation probably is that lines 4-5 of stanza 49 are in bad shape.\n\n51. ~<Five brothers~>: the ~<Volsungasaga~> speaks of four (not five) sons of Buthli, but names only Atli. Regarding the death of the first two brothers cf. stanza 91 and note. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3-4 with stanza 52. Some insert lines 2-3 of stanza 52 ahead of lines 3-4 of stanza 51.\n\n52. Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza, which is impossible unless something has been lost. ~<Gold~>: the meaning of this half line is somewhat doubtful, but apparently Atli refers to Sigurth's treasure, which should have been his as Brynhild's brother. ~<Sister~>: Brynhild; regarding Guthrun's indirect responsibility for Brynhild's death cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 45 and note.]",

				"~<Guthrun spake:~>\n53. \"Hear me now, Atli! | the first evil was thine;\nMy mother didst thou take, | and for gold didst murder her,\nMy sister's daughter | thou didst starve in a prison.\nA jest does it seem | that thy sorrow thou tellest,\nAnd good do I find it | that grief to thee comes.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n54. \"Go now, ye warriors, | and make greater the grief\nOf the woman so fair, | for fain would I see it;\nSo fierce be thy warring | that Guthrun shall weep,\nI would gladly behold | her happiness lost.\n\n55. \"Seize ye now Hogni, | and with knives shall ye hew him,\nHis heart shall ye cut out, | this haste ye to do;\nAnd grim-hearted Gunnar | shall ye bind on the gallows,\n\n[53. The manuscript does not name the speaker. ~<The Volsungasaga~> gives the speech, in somewhat altered form, to Hogni. \"Why speakest thou so? Thou wast the first to break peace; thou didst take my kinswoman and starved her in a prison, and murdered her and took her wealth; that was not kinglike; and laughable does it seem to me that thou talkest of thy sorrow, and good shall I find it that all goes ill with thee.\" This presumably represents the correct form of the stanza, for nowhere else is it intimated that Atli killed Guthrun's mother, Grimhild, nor is the niece elsewhere mentioned. Some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5, Grundtvig adding a line after line 3 and two more after line 5. Other editors are doubtful about the authenticity of either line 3 or line 5.\n\n54. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.]",

				"Swift shall ye do it, | to serpents now cast him.\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n56. \"Do now as thou wilt, | for glad I await it,\nBrave shalt thou find me, | I have faced worse before;\nWe held thee at bay | while whole we were fighting,\nNow with wounds are we spent, | so thy will canst thou work.\"\n\n57.

Afraid was the pot-watcher, | he fled here and yon,\nAnd crazed with his terror | he climbed in the corners:\n\n[56. The text of the first half of line 3 is somewhat uncertain, but the general meaning of it is clear enough.\n\n57. Beiti: not elsewhere mentioned. The ~<Atlakvitha~> version of this episode (stanzas 23-25) does not mention Beiti, and in the ~<Volsungasaga~> the advice to cut out Hjalli's heart instead of Hogni's is given by an unnamed \"counsellor of Atli.\" In the ~<Atlakvitha~> Hjalli is actually killed; the ~<Volsungasaga~> combines the two versions by having Hjalli first let off at Hogni's intercession and then seized a second time and killed, thus introducing the ~<Atlakvitha~> episode of the quaking heart (stanza 24). The text of the first half of line 3 is obscure, and there are many and widely varying suggestions as to the word here rendered \"sluggard.\"\n\n58. Some editions mark line 5 as probably interpolated.]",

The ~<Volsungasaga~> does not paraphrase lines 3-5; the passage may be a later addition, and line 5 is almost certainly so.\n\n61. It is probable that a stanza describing the casting of Gunnar into the serpents' den has been lost after this stanza. ~<Sons of day~>: the phrase means no more than \"men.\"]",

Regarding Gunnar's harp-playing, and his death, cf. ~<Oddrunargratr~>, 27-30 and notes, and ~<Atlakvitha~>, 34. ~<Toes~> (literally \"sole-twigs\"): the ~<Volsungasaga~> explains that Gunnar's hands were bound. ~<Rafters~>: thus literally, and probably correctly; Gering has an ingenious but unlikely theory that the word means \"harp.\"\n\n63. There is some doubt as to the exact meaning of line 2. After this line two lines may have! been lost; Grundtvig adds: \"Few braver shall ever | be found on the earth, / Or loftier men | in the world ever give.\"\n\n64. ~<Wise one~>: Guthrun.

The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.\n\n66. The manuscript does not name the speaker. The negative in the first half of line 1 is uncertain, and most editions make the clause read \"Of this guilt I can free myself.\" ~<The fairest~>, etc.: i. e., I have often failed to do the wise thing.\n\n67. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. ~<Requital~>, etc.: it is not clear just to what Guthrun refers; perhaps she is thinking of Sigurth's death, or possibly the poet had in mind his reference to the slaying of her mother in stanza 53.]",

Full heedless the warrior | was that he trusted her,\nSo clear was her guile | if on guard he had been;\nBut crafty was Guthrun, | with cunning she spake,\nHer glance she made pleasant, | with two shields she played.\n\n[68. Line 5 is very probably a later addition, though some editors question line 3 instead.\n\n69. Guthrun suddenly changes her tone in order to make Atli believe that she is submissive to his will, and thus to gain time for her vengeance. Line 2 in the original is thoroughly obscure; it runs literally: \"On the knee goes the fist if the twigs are taken off.\" Perhaps the word meaning \"fist\" may also have meant \"tree-top,\" as Gering suggests, or perhaps the line is an illogical blending of the ideas contained in lines 1 and 3.\n\n70. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza, ~<Two shields~>, etc.: i. e., Guthrun concealed her hostility (symbolized by a red shield, cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana~> I, 34) by a show of friendliness (a white shield).]",

The beer then she brought | for her brothers' death feast,\nAnd a feast Atli made | for his followers dead\nNo more did they speak, | the mead was made ready,\nSoon the men were gathered | with mighty uproar.\n\n72.

The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza; some editions make a separate stanza of lines 3-5, while others combine them with lines 1-2 of stanza 73. Line 2 in the original is clearly defective, the verb being omitted. The meaning of line 3 is uncertain; the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase has: \"At evening she took the sons of King Atli (Erp and Eitil) where they were playing with a block of wood.\" Probably the text of the line as we have it is faulty. Lines 4-5 may possibly have been expanded out of a single line, or line 5 may be spurious.]",

The manuscript does not name the speakers. It indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza, in which it is followed by many editions. The ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrases line 4 thus: \"But it is shameful for thee to do this.\" Either the text of the line has been changed or the ~<Volsungasaga~> compilers misunderstood it. ~<The angry one~>: Atli.\n\n74.

'I cut out their hearts, | on a spit I cooked them,\nI came to thee with them, | and calf's flesh I called them;\nAlone didst thou eat them, | nor any didst leave,\n\n[76. ~<Morning~>: Guthrun refers to Atli's taunt in stanza 64.\n\n77. The manuscript indicates no gap (lines 1-2), and most editions make a single line, despite the defective meter: \"Thy sons hast thou lost | as thou never shouldst lose them.\" The second part of line 2 is in the original identical with the second half of line 3 of stanza 80, and may perhaps have been inserted here by mistake. ~<Skulls~>: it is possible that line 3 was borrowed from a poem belonging to the Völund tradition (cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 25 and 37), and the idea doubtless came from some such source, but probably the poet inserted it in a line of his own composition to give an added touch of horror. The ~<Volsungasaga~> follows the ~<Atlamol~> in including this incident.]",

				"Thou didst greedily bite, | and thy teeth were busy.\n\n79. \"Of thy sons now thou knowest; | few suffer more sorrow;\nMy guilt have I told, | fame it never shall give me.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n80. \"Grim wast thou, Guthrun, | in so grievous a deed,\nMy draught with the blood | of thy boys to mingle;\nThou hast slain thine own kin, | most ill it be seemed thee,\nAnd little for me | twixt my sorrows thou leavest.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n81. \"Still more would I seek | to slay thee thyself,\nEnough ill comes seldom | to such as thou art;\nThou didst folly of old, | such that no one shall find\n\n[78. Some editions add lines 5-4 to stanza 79; Finnur Jonsson marks them as probably spurious.\n\n79. Perhaps these two lines should form part of stanza 78, or perhaps they, rather than lines 3-4 of stanza 78, are a later addition. A gap of two lines after line 1 has also been conjectured.\n\n80. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.\n\n81. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. Lines 1-2 may be the remains of a separate stanza; Grundtvig adds: \"Thou wast foolish, Atli, | when wise thou didst feel, / Ever the whole | of thy race did I hate.\" The Volsungasaga paraphrase, however, indicates no gap. Many editions make a separate stanza of lines 3-6, which, in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, are paraphrased as a speech of Atli's. Lines 5-6 may be spurious.]",

				"In the whole world of men | a match for such madness.\nNow this that of late | we learned hast thou added,\nGreat evil hast grasped, | and thine own death feast made.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n82. \"With fire shall they burn thee, | and first shall they stone thee,\nSo then hast thou earned | what thou ever hast sought for.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n\"Such woes for thyself | shalt thou say in the morning,\nFrom a finer death I | to another light fare.\"\n\n83.

Introductory Note.\n\n83. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza. ~<Hniflung~>: the ~<Volsungasaga~> says that \"Hogni had a son who was called Hniflung,\" but the name appears to be nothing more than the familiar \"Niflung\" applied in general to the sons of Gjuki and their people. On the spelling cf. note on stanza 44.]",

				"84. To her heart came ever | the fate of Hogni,\nShe told him 'twere well | if he vengeance should win;\nSo was Atli slain,-- | 'twas not slow to await,--\nHogni's son slew him, | and Guthrun herself.\n\n85. Then the warrior spake, | as from slumber he wakened,\nSoon he knew for his wounds | would the bandage do nought:\n\"Now the truth shalt thou say: | who has slain Buthli's son?\nFull sore am I smitten, | nor hope can I see.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n86. \"Ne'er her deed from thee hides | the daughter of Grimhild,\n\n[This son of Hogni appears in later versions of the story. In the ~<Thithrekssaga~> he is called Aldrian, and is begotten by Hogni the night before his death. Aldrian grows up and finally shuts Attila in a cave where he starves to death. The poet here has incorporated the idea, which finds no parallel in the ~<Atlakvitha~>, without troubling himself to straighten out the chronology.\n\n84.

The manuscript does not name the speakers. It marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and many editions follow this arrangement, in most cases making a stanza of lines 4-5 and line 1 of stanza 87. However, line 1 may well have been interpolated here from stanza 75. Grundtvig adds after line 3: \"His father he avenged, and his kinsmen fully.\" Some editors assume the loss of one or two lines after line 5.]",

				"I gave thirty slaves, | and handmaidens seven;\nThere was honor in such gifts, | yet the silver was greater.\n\n90. \"But all to thee was | as if nought it were worth,\nWhile the land lay before thee | that Buthli had left me;\nThou in secret didst work | so the treasure I won not;\nMy mother full oft | to sit weeping didst make,\nNo wedded joy found I | in fullness of heart.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n91. \"Thou liest now, Atli, | though little I heed it;\n\n[Grundtvig adds: \"Bit-champing horses and wheel-wagons bright.\" Line 4 may be spurious. ~<Greater~>: i. e., the silver which Atli gave Guthrun was of greater value even than the honor of receiving such royal gifts. Line 4 may be spurious.\n\n90. Some editions mark line 3 as spurious or defective. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza. ~<The land~>, etc.: there is much obscurity as to the significance of this line. Some editors omit or question \"me,\" in which case Atli is apparently reproaching Guthrun for having incited him to fight with his brothers to win for himself the whole of Buthli's land. In stanza 91 Guthrun denies that she was to blame for Atli's quarrels with his brothers. The ~<Volsungasaga~> reading supports this interpretation. The historical Attila did actually have his brother, Bleda, killed in order to have the sole rule. ~<The treasure~>: Sigurth's hoard, which Atli claimed as the brother of Brynhild and husband of Guthrun, Sigurth's widow, but which Gunnar and Hogni kept for themselves, with, as Atli here charges, Guthrun's connivance. ~<My mother~>: the only other reference to Atli's mother is in ~<Oddrunargratr~>, 30, wherein she appears as the adder who stings Gunnar to death, and in the prose passages based on that stanza.]",

				"If I seldom was kindly, | full cruel wast thou;\nYe brothers fought young, | quarrels brought you to battle,\nAnd half went to hell | of the sons of thy house,\nAnd all was destroyed | that should e'er have done good.\n\n92. \"My two brothers and I | were bold in our thoughts,\nFrom the land we went forth, | with Sigurth we fared;\nFull swiftly we sailed, | each one steering his ship,\nSo our fate sought we e'er | till we came to the East.\n\n93. \"First the king did we slay, | and the land we seized,\n\n[91. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. It marks both lines 4 and 5 as beginning new stanzas, but line 5 is presumably an interpolation. The text of the second half of line 2 is obscure, and many emendations have been suggested. ~<Ye brothers~>: cf. note on stanza go. ~<Half~>: i. e., two of Atli's brothers were killed, the other two dying in the battle with Gunnar and Hogni; cf. stanza 51.\n\n92. ~<From the land~>: this maritime expedition of Guthrun and her two brothers, Gunnar and Hogni (the poet seems to know nothing of her half-brother, Gotthorm), with Sigurth seems to have been a pure. invention of the poet's, inserted for the benefit of his Greenland hearers. Nothing further is reported concerning it.\n\n93. ~<The forest~>: i. e., men who were outlawed in the conquered land were restored to their rights--another purely Norse touch.]",

				"The princes did us service, | for such was their fear;\nFrom the forest we called | them we fain would have guiltless,\nAnd rich made we many | who of all were bereft.\n\n94. \"Slain was the Hun-king, | soon happiness vanished,\nIn her grief the widow | so young sat weeping;\nYet worse seemed the sorrow | to seek Atli's house,\nA hero was my husband, | and hard was his loss.\n\n95. \"From the Thing thou camst never, | for thus have we heard,\nHaving won in thy quarrels, | or warriors smitten;\nFull yielding thou wast, | never firm was thy will,\nIn silence didst suffer, |  . . . . .\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n96. \"Thou liest now, Guthrun, | but little of good\n\n[94. ~<Hun-king~>: Sigurth, though most illogically so called; cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 4 and note. The Volsungasaga paraphrase of line 2 is so remote as to be puzzling: \"It was little to bear the name of widow.\" Perhaps, however, the word \"not\" fell out between \"was\" and \"little.\"\n\n95. ~<Thing~>, etc.: here the poet makes Atli into a typical Norse land-owner, going to the \"Thing,\" or general law council, to settle his disputes. Even the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> could not accept this, and in their paraphrase changed \"Thing\" to \"battle.\" The text of the second half of line 2 is uncertain. The manuscript leaves a blank to indicate the gap in-line 4; Grundtvig adds: \"as beseems not a king.\"]",

				"Will it bring to either, | for all have we lost;\nBut, Guthrun, yet once | be thou kindly of will,\nFor the honor of both, | when forth I am home.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n97. \"A ship will I buy, | and a bright-hued coffin,\nI will wax well the shroud | to wind round thy body,\nFor all will I care | as if dear were we ever.\"\n\n98.

The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. Many editors assume a gap either before or after line 1. ~<A ship~>: the burial of Norse chiefs in ships was of frequent occurrence, but the Greenland poet's application of the custom to Atli is some what grotesque.\n\n98. ~<Heirs~>, etc.: merely a stock phrase, here quite meaningless, as Atli's heirs had all been killed. ~<Long~>: cf. ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, introductory prose.]"
