As the other planes are made of pure magic, it is almost impossible for their inhabitants to travel to the material plane, as the difference in the composition of the realms would risk the traveller's very existence. The major exception being that particularly powerful mortal sorcerers are sometimes able to summon extraplanar beings for very short periods of time, maintaining their presence in a great effort of magical prowess. As more powerful extraplanar creatures are generally more rich in magic, they are also more difficult to summon."

The plane harbors the souls of the dead who worshiped the Aesir, and yet were deemed unworthy of entry into Asgard by virtue of not having died in battle. In Helheim lies one of the roots of the mighty interplanar tree, Yggdrasill, the root having been corrupted by the dark forces of the plane.",
