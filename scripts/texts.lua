					"There is scarcely any literary work of great importance which has been less readily available for the general reader, or even for the serious student of literature, than the Poetic Edda. Translations have been far from numerous, and only in Germany has the complete work of translation been done in the full light of recent scholarship. In English the only versions were long the conspicuously inadequate one made by Thorpe, and published about half a century ago, and the unsatisfactory prose translations in Vigfusson and Powell's ~<Corpus Poeticum Boreale~>, reprinted in the Norroena collection. An excellent translation of the poems dealing with the gods, in verse and with critical and explanatory notes, made by Olive Bray, was, however, published by the Viking Club of London in 1908. In French there exist only partial translations, chief among them being those made by Bergmann many years ago. Among the seven or eight German versions, those by the Brothers Grimm and by Karl Simrock, which had considerable historical importance because of their influence on nineteenth century German literature and art, and particularly on the work of Richard Wagner, have been largely superseded by Hugo Gering's admirable translation, published in 1892, and by the recent two volume rendering by Genzmer, with excellent notes by Andreas Heusler, 194-1920. There are competent translations in both Norwegian and Swedish. The lack of any complete and adequately annotated English rendering in metrical form, based on a critical text, and profiting by the cumulative labors of such scholars as Mogk, Vigfusson,",

Olsen, Sievers, Sijmons, Detter, Heinzel, Falk, Neckel, Heusler, and Gering, has kept this extraordinary work practically out of the reach of those who have had neither time nor inclination to master the intricacies of the original Old Norse. \n\nOn the importance of the material contained in the ~<Poetic Edda~> it is here needless to dwell at any length. We have inherited the Germanic traditions in our very speech, and the ~<Poetic Edda~> is the original storehouse of Germanic mythology. It is, indeed, in many ways the greatest literary monument preserved to us out of the antiquity of the kindred races which we call Germanic. Moreover, it has a literary value altogether apart from its historical significance. The mythological poems include, in the ~<Voluspo~>, one of the vastest conceptions of the creation and ultimate destruction of the world ever crystallized in literary form; in parts of the ~<Hovamol~>, a collection of wise counsels that can bear comparison with most of the Biblical Book of Proverbs; in the ~<Lokasenna~>, a comedy none the less full of vivid characterization because its humor is often broad; and in the ~<Thrymskvitha~>, one of the finest ballads in the world. The hero poems give us, in its oldest and most vivid extant form, the story of Sigurth, Brynhild, and Atli, the Norse parallel to the German ~<Nibelungenlied~>. The Poetic Edda is not only of great interest to the student of antiquity; it is a collection including some of the most remark able poems which have been preserved to us from the period before the pen and the printing-press. replaced the poet-singer and oral tradition. It is above all else the desire", -- should be "Lüning" instead of "Luening", "Ettmüller" instead of "Ettmueller", and "Müllenhoff" instead of "Muellenhoff"
					"to make better known the dramatic force, the vivid and often tremendous imagery, and the superb conceptions embodied in these poems which has called forth the present translation. \n\n~<What is the Poetic Edda?~>\n\nEven if the poems of the so-called Edda were not so significant and intrinsically so valuable, the long series of scholarly struggles which have been going on over them for the better part of three centuries would in itself give them a peculiar interest. Their history is strangely mysterious. We do not know who composed them, or when or where they were composed; we are by no means sure who collected them or when he did so; finally, we are not absolutely certain as to what an \"Edda\" is, and the best guess at the meaning of the word renders its application to this collection of poems more or less misleading. \n\nA brief review of the chief facts in the history of the ~<Poetic Edda~> will explain why this uncertainty has persisted. Preserved in various manuscripts of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries is a prose work consisting of a very extensive collection of mythological stories, an explanation of the important figures and tropes of Norse poetic diction,--the poetry of the Icelandic and Norwegian skalds was appallingly complex in this respect,--and a treatise on metrics. This work, clearly a handbook for poets, was commonly known as the \"Edda\" of Snorri Sturluson, for at the head of the copy of it in the ~<Uppsalabok~>, a manuscript written presumably some fifty or sixty years after Snorri's death, which was in 1241, we find: \"This book is called Edda, which Snorri Sturluson composed.\" This work, well known as the ~<Prose Edda~>, Snorri's ~<Edda~> or the",
					
					"~<Younger Edda~>, has recently been made available to readers of English in the admirable translation by Arthur G. Brodeur, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1916.\n\nIcelandic tradition, however, persisted in ascribing either this ~<Edda~> or one resembling it to Snorri's much earlier compatriot, Saemund the Wise (1056-1133). When, early in the seventeenth century, the learned Arngrimur Jonsson proved to everyone's satisfaction that Snorri and nobody else must have been responsible for the work in question, the next thing to determine was what, if anything, Saemund had done of the same kind. The nature of Snorri's book gave a clue. In the mythological stories related a number of poems were quoted, and as these and other poems were to all appearances Snorri's chief sources of information, it was assumed that Saemund must have written or compiled a verse ~<Edda~>--whatever an \"Edda\" might be--on which Snorri's work was largely based.\n\nSo matters stood when, in 1643, Brynjolfur Sveinsson, Bishop of Skalholt, discovered a manuscript, clearly written as early as 1300, containing twenty-nine poems, complete or fragmentary, and some of them with the very lines and stanzas used by Snorri. Great was the joy of the scholars, for here, of course, must be at least a part of the long-sought ~<Edda~> of Saemund the Wise. Thus the good bishop promptly labeled his find, and as Saemund's ~<Edda~>, the ~<Elder Edda~> or the ~<Poetic Edda~> it has been known to this day.\n\nThis precious manuscript, now in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and known as the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> (R2365), has been the basis for all published editions of the Eddic poems. A few poems of similar character found elsewhere", -- should be "Sæmund" instead of "Saemund"
					
					"have subsequently been added to the collection, until now most editions include, as in this translation, a total of thirty-four. A shorter manuscript now in the Arnamagnaean collection in Copenhagen (AM748), contains fragmentary or complete versions of six of the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~>, and one other, ~<Baldrs Draumar~>, not found in that collection. Four other poems (~<Rigsthula~>, ~<Hyndluljoth~>, ~<Grougaldr~> and ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~>, the last two here combined under the title of Svipdagsmol), from various manuscripts, so closely resemble in subject-matter and style the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~> that they have been included by most editors in the collection. Finally, Snorri's ~<Edda~> contains one complete poem, the ~<Grottasongr~>, which many editors have added to the poetic collection; it is, however, not included in this translation, as an admirable English version of it is available in Mr. Brodeur's rendering of Snorri's work.\n\nFrom all this it is evident that the ~<Poetic Edda~>, as we now know it, is no definite and plainly limited work, but rather a more or less haphazard collection of separate poems, dealing either with Norse mythology or with hero-cycles unrelated to the traditional history of greater Scandinavia or Iceland. How many other similar poems, now lost, may have existed in such collections as were current in Iceland in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries we cannot know, though it is evident that some poems of this type are missing. We can say only that thirty-four poems have been preserved, twenty-nine of them in a single manuscript collection, which differ considerably in subject-matter and style from all the rest of extant Old Norse poetry, and these we group together as the ~<Poetic Edda~>.", -- should be "Arnamagnæan" instead of "Arnamagnaean"
					
					"But what does the word \"Edda\" mean? Various guesses have been made. An early assumption was that the word somehow meant \"Poetics,\" which fitted Snorri's treatise to a nicety, but which, in addition to the lack of philological evidence to support this interpretation, could by no stretch of scholarly subtlety be made appropriate to the collection of poems. Jacob Grimm ingeniously identified the word with the word \"edda\" used in one of the poems, the ~<Rigsthula~>, where, rather conjecturally, it means \"great-grand mother.\" The word exists in this sense no where else in Norse literature, and Grimm's suggestion of \"Tales of a Grandmother,\" though at one time it found wide acceptance, was grotesquely inappropriate to either the prose or the verse work.\n\nAt last Eirikr Magnusson hit on what appears the likeliest solution of the puzzle: that \"Edda\" is simply the genitive form of the proper name \"Oddi.\" Oddi was a settlement in the southwest of Iceland, certainly the home of Snorri Sturluson for many years, and, traditionally at least, also the home of Saemund the Wise. That Snorri's work should have been called \"The Book of Oddi\" is altogether reasonable, for such a method of naming books was common--witness the \"Book of the Flat Island\" and other early manuscripts. That Saemund may also have written or compiled another \"Oddi-Book\" is perfectly possible, and that tradition should have said he did so is entirely natural.\n\nIt is, however, an open question whether or not Saemund had anything to do with making the collection, or any part of it, now known as the Poetic Edda, for of course the seventeenth-century assignment of the work to him is negligible.", -- should be "Sæmund" instead of "Saemund"
					
					"We can say only that he may have made some such compilation, for he was a diligent student of Icelandic tradition and history, and was famed throughout the North for his learning. But otherwise no trace of his works survives, and as he was educated in Paris, it is probable that he wrote rather in Latin than in the vernacular.\n\nAll that is reasonably certain is that by the middle or last of the twelfth century there existed in Iceland one or more written collections of Old Norse mythological and heroic poems, that the ~<Codex Regius~>, a copy made a hundred years or so later, represents at least a considerable part of one of these, and that the collection of thirty-four poems which we now know as the ~<Poetic~> or ~<Elder Edda~> is practically all that has come down to us of Old Norse poetry of this type. Anything more is largely guesswork, and both the name of the compiler and the meaning of the title \"Edda\" are conjectural.\n\n~<The Origin of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThere is even less agreement about the birthplace, authorship and date of the Eddic poems themselves than about the nature of the existing collection. Clearly the poems were the work of many different men, living in different periods; clearly, too, most of them existed in oral tradition for generations before they were committed to writing. In general, the mythological poems seem strongly marked by pagan sincerity, although efforts have been made to prove them the results of deliberate archaizing; and as Christianity became generally accepted throughout the Norse world early in the eleventh century, it seems altogether likely that most of the poems dealing",
					
					"with the gods definitely antedate the year 1000. The earlier terminus is still a matter of dispute. The general weight of critical opinion, based chiefly on the linguistic evidence presented by Hoffory, Finnur Jonsson and others, has indicated that the poems did not assume anything closely analogous to their present forms prior to the ninth century. On the other hand, Magnus Olsen's interpretation of the inscriptions on the Eggjum Stone, which he places as early as the seventh century, have led so competent a scholar as Birger Nerman to say that \"we may be warranted in concluding that some of the Eddic poems may have originated, wholly or partially, in the second part of the seventh century.\" As for the poems belonging to the hero cycles, one or two of them appear to be as late as 1100, but most of them probably date back at least to the century and a half following 900. It is a reasonable guess that the years between 850 and 1050 saw the majority of the Eddic poems worked into definite shape, but it must be remembered that many changes took place during the long subsequent period of oral transmission, and also that many of the legends, both mythological and heroic, on which the poems were based certainly existed in the Norse regions, and quite possibly in verse form, long before the year 900.\n\nAs to the origin of the legends on which the poems are based, the whole question, at least so far as the stories of the gods are concerned, is much too complex for discussion here. How much of the actual narrative material of the mythological lays is properly to be called Scandinavian is a matter for students of comparative mythology to",
					
					"guess at. The tales underlying the heroic lays are clearly of foreign origin: the Helgi story comes from Denmark, and that of Voelund from Germany, as also the great mass of traditions centering around Sigurth (Siegfried), Brynhild, the sons of Gjuki, Atli (Attila), and Jormunrek (Ermanarich). The introductory notes to the various poems deal with the more important of these questions of origin. of the men who composed these poems,--\"wrote\" is obviously the wrong word--we know absolutely nothing, save that some of them must have been literary artists with a high degree of conscious skill. The Eddic poems are \"folk-poetry,\"--whatever that may be,--only in the sense that some of them strongly reflect racial feelings and beliefs; they are anything but crude or primitive in workmanship, and they show that not only the poets themselves, but also many of their hearers, must have made a careful study of the art of poetry.\n\nWhere the poems were shaped is equally uncertain. Any date prior to 875 would normally imply an origin on the mainland, but the necessarily fluid state of oral tradition made it possible for a poem to be \"composed\" many times over, and in various and far-separated places, without altogether losing its identity. Thus, even if a poem first assumed something approximating its present form in Iceland in the tenth century, it may none the less embody language characteristic of Norway two centuries earlier. Oral poetry has always had an amazing preservative power over language, and in considering the origins of such poems as these, we must cease thinking in terms of the printing-press, or even in those of the scribe. The", -- should be "Völund" instead of "Voelund"
					
					"claims of Norway as the birthplace of most of the Eddic poems have been extensively advanced, but the great literary activity of Iceland after the settlement of the island by Norwegian emigrants late in the ninth century makes the theory of an Icelandic home for many of the poems appear plausible. The two Atli lays, with what authority we do not know, bear in the ~<Codex Regius~> the superscription \"the Greenland poem,\" and internal evidence suggests that this statement may be correct. Certainly in one poem, the ~<Rigsthula~>, and probably in several others, there are marks of Celtic influence. During a considerable part of the ninth and tenth centuries, Scandinavians were active in Ireland and in most of the western islands inhabited by branches of the Celtic race. Some scholars have, indeed, claimed nearly all the Eddic poems for these \"Western Isles.\" However, as Iceland early came to be the true cultural center of this Scandinavian island world, it may be said that the preponderant evidence concerning the development of the Eddic poems in anything like their present form points in that direction, and certainly it was in Iceland that they were chiefly preserved.\n\n~<The Edda and Old Norse Literature~>\n\nWithin the proper limits of an introduction it would be impossible to give any adequate summary of the history and literature with which the Eddic poems are indissolubly connected, but a mere mention of a few of the salient facts may be of some service to those who are unfamiliar with the subject. Old Norse literature covers approximately the period between 850 and 1300. During the first part of",
					
					"that period occurred the great wanderings of the Scandinavian peoples, and particularly the Norwegians. A convenient date to remember is that of the sea-fight of Hafrsfjord, 872, when Harald the Fair-Haired broke the power of the independent Norwegian nobles, and made himself overlord of nearly all the country. Many of the defeated nobles fled overseas, where inviting refuges had been found for them by earlier wanderers and plunder-seeking raiders. This was the time of the inroads of the dreaded Northmen in France, and in 885 Hrolf Gangr (Rollo) laid siege to Paris itself. Many Norwegians went to Ireland, where their compatriots had already built Dublin, and where they remained in control of most of the island till Brian Boru shattered their power at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.\n\nOf all the migrations, however, the most important were those to Iceland. Here grew up an active civilization, fostered by absolute independence and by remoteness from the wars which wracked Norway, yet kept from degenerating into provincialism by the roving life of the people, which brought them constantly in contact with the culture of the South. Christianity, introduced throughout the Norse world about the year 1000, brought with it the stability of learning, and the Icelanders became not only the makers but also the students and recorders of history. The years between 875 and 1100 were the great spontaneous period of oral literature. Most of the military and political leaders were also poets, and they composed a mass of lyric poetry concerning the authorship of which we know a good deal, and much of which has been preserved. Narrative",
					
					"prose also flourished, for the Icelander had a passion for story-telling and story-hearing. After 1100 came the day of the writers. These sagamen collected the material that for generations had passed from mouth to mouth, and gave it permanent form in writing. The greatest bulk of what we now have of Old Norse literature,--and the published part of it makes a formidable library,--originated thus in the earlier period before the introduction of writing, and was put into final shape by the scholars, most of them Icelanders, of the hundred years following 1150.\n\nAfter 1250 came a rapid and tragic decline. Iceland lost its independence, becoming a Norwegian province. Later Norway too fell under alien rule, a Swede ascending the Norwegian throne in 1320. Pestilence and famine laid waste the whole North; volcanic disturbances worked havoc in Iceland. Literature did not quite die, but it fell upon evil days; for the vigorous native narratives and heroic poems of the older period were substituted translations of French romances. The poets wrote mostly doggerel; the prose writers were devoid of national or racial inspiration.\n\nThe mass of literature thus collected and written down largely between 1150 and 1250 maybe roughly divided into four groups. The greatest in volume is made up of the sagas: narratives mainly in prose, ranging all the way from authentic history of the Norwegian kings and the early Icelandic settlements to fairy-tales. Embodied in the sagas is found the material composing the second group: the skaldic poetry, a vast collection of songs of praise, triumph, love, lamentation, and so on, almost uniformly characterized",
					
					"by an appalling complexity of figurative language. There is no absolute line to be drawn between the poetry of the skalds and the poems of the ~<Edda~>, which we may call the third group; but in addition to the remarkable artificiality of style which marks the skaldic poetry, and which is seldom found in the poems of the ~<Edda~>, the skalds dealt almost exclusively with their own emotions, whereas the Eddic poems are quite impersonal. Finally, there is the fourth group, made up of didactic works, religious and legal treatises, and so on, studies which originated chiefly in the later period of learned activity.\n\n~<Preservation of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nMost of the poems of the ~<Poetic Edda~> have unquestionably reached us in rather bad shape. During the long period of oral transmission they suffered all sorts of interpolations, omissions and changes, and some of them, as they now stand, are a bewildering hodge-podge of little related fragments. To some extent the diligent twelfth century compiler to whom we owe the ~<Codex Regius~>--Saemund or another--was himself doubtless responsible for the patchwork process, often supplemented by narrative prose notes of his own; but in the days before written records existed, it was easy to lose stanzas and longer passages from their context, and equally easy to interpolate them where they did not by any means belong. Some few of the poems, however, appear to be virtually complete and unified as we now have them.\n\nUnder such circumstances it is clear that the establishment of a satisfactory text is a matter of the utmost difficulty. As the basis for this translation I have used the text", -- should be "Sæmund" instead of "Saemund"
					
					"prepared by Karl Hildebrand (1876) and revised by Hugo Gering (1904). Textual emendation has, however, been so extensive in every edition of the ~<Edda~>, and has depended so much on the theories of the editor, that I have also made extensive use of many other editions, notably those by Finnur Jonsson, Neckel, Sijmons, and Detter and Heinzel, together with numerous commentaries. The condition of the text in both the principal codices is such that no great reliance can be placed on the accuracy of the copyists, and frequently two editions will differ fundamentally as to their readings of a given passage or even of an entire-poem. For this reason, and because guesswork necessarily plays so large a part in any edition or translation of the Eddic poems, I have risked overloading the pages with textual notes in order to show, as nearly as possible, the exact state of the original together with all the more significant emendations. I have done this particularly in the case of transpositions, many of which appear absolutely necessary, and in the indication of passages which appear to be interpolations.\n\n~<The Verse-Forms of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThe many problems connected with the verse-forms found in the Eddic poems have been analyzed in great detail by Sievers, Neckel, and others. The three verse-forms exemplified in the poems need only a brief comment here, however, in order to make clear the method used in this translation. All of these forms group the lines normally in four-line stanzas. In the so-called Fornyrthislag (\"Old Verse\"), for convenience sometimes referred to in the notes as four-four measure, these lines have all the same",
					
					"structure, each line being sharply divided by a caesural pause into two half-lines, and each half-line having two accented syllables and two (sometimes three) unaccented ones. The two half-lines forming a complete line are bound together by the alliteration, or more properly initial-rhyme, of three (or two) of the accented syllables. The following is an example of the Fornyrthislag stanza, the accented syllables being in italics:\n\n\t\t~<Vreithr~> vas ~<Ving~>thorr, | es ~<vakna~>thi\n\t\tok ~<sins ham~>ars | of ~<sakna~>thi;\n\t\t~<skegg~> nam ~<hris~>ta, | ~<skor~> nam ~<dy~>ja,\n\t\t~<re~>th ~<Jarth~>ar ~<burr~> | ~<umb~> at ~<threif~>ask.\n\nIn the second form, the Ljothahattr (\"Song Measure\"), the first and third line of each stanza are as just described, but the second and fourth are shorter, have no caesural pause, have three accented syllables, and regularly two initial-rhymed accented syllables, for which reason I have occasionally referred to Ljothahattr as four-three measure. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Ar~> skal ~<ri~>sa | sas ~<an~>nars ~<vill~>\n\t\t\t~<fe~> etha ~<fior haf~>a;\n\t\t~<ligg~>jandi ~<ulfr~> | sjaldan ~<laer~> of ~<getr~>\n\t\t\tne ~<sof~>andi ~<mathr sigr~>.\n\nIn the third and least commonly used form, the Malahattr (\"Speech Measure\"), a younger verse-form than either of the other two, each line of the four-line stanza is divided into two half-lines by a caesural pause, each half line having two accented syllables and three (sometimes", -- should be "cæsural" instead of "caesural"; had to replace the "Þ"s with "th"s; had to remove the accents
					
					"four) unaccented ones; the initial rhyme is as in the Fornyrthislag. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Horsk~> vas ~<hus~>freyja, | ~<hug~>thi at ~<mann~>viti,\n\t\t~<lag~> heyrthi ~<or~>tha, | hvat a ~<laun mael~>tu;\n\t\ttha vas ~<vant vit~>ri, | ~<vil~>di theim ~<hjalth~>a:\n\t\tskyldu of ~<sae sig~>la, | en ~<sjolf~> ne ~<kvamsk~>at.\n\nA poem in Fornyrthislag is normally entitled -~<kvitha~> (~<Thrymskvitha~>, ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>, etc.), which for convenience I have rendered as \"lay,\" while a poem in Ljothahattr is entitled -~<mol~> (~<Grimnismol~>, ~<Skirnismol~>, etc.), which I have rendered as \"ballad.\" It is difficult to find any distinction other than metrical between the two terms, although it is clear that one originally existed.\n\nVariations frequently appear in all three kinds of verse, and these I have attempted to indicate through the rhythm of the translation. In order to preserve so far as possible the effect of the Eddic verse, I have adhered, in making the English version, to certain of the fundamental rules governing the Norse line and stanza formations. The number of lines to each stanza conforms to what seems the best guess as to the original, and I have consistently retained the number of accented syllables. in translating from a highly inflected language into one depending largely on the use of subsidiary words, it has, however, been necessary to employ considerable freedom as to the number of unaccented syllables in a line. The initial-rhyme is generally confined to two accented syllables in each line. As in the original, all initial vowels are allowed to rhyme interchangeably, but I have disregarded the rule which lets certain groups of consonants rhyme only with themselves", -- had to replace the "Þ"s with "th"s; had to remove the accents

					"~<Voluspo~>\n\n~<The Wise-Woman's Prophecy~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nAt the beginning of the collection in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> stands the Voluspo, the most famous and important, as it is likewise the most debated, of all the Eddic poems. Another version of it is found in a huge miscellaneous compilation of about the year 1300, the ~<Hauksbok~>, and many stanzas are included in the ~<Prose Edda~> of Snorri Sturluson. The order of the stanzas in the ~<Hauksbok~> version differs materially from that in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and in the published editions many experiments have been attempted in further rearrangements. On the whole, how ever, and allowing for certain interpolations, the order of the stanzas in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> seems more logical than any of the wholesale \"improvements\" which have been undertaken.\n\nThe general plan of the ~<Voluspo~> is fairly clear. Othin, chief of the gods, always conscious of impending disaster and eager for knowledge, calls on a certain \"Volva,\" or wise-woman, presumably bidding her rise from the grave. She first tells him of the past, of the creation of the world, the beginning of years, the origin of the dwarfs (at this point there is a clearly interpolated catalogue of dwarfs' names, stanzas 10-16), of the first man and woman, of the world-ash Yggdrasil, and of the first war, between the gods and the Vanir, or, in Anglicized form, the Wanes. Then, in stanzas 27-29, as a further proof of her wisdom, she discloses some of Othin's own secrets and the details of his search for knowledge. Rewarded by Othin for what she has thus far told (stanza 30), she then turns to the real prophesy, the disclosure of the final destruction of the gods. This final battle, in which fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight with their enemies, is the great fact in Norse mythology; the phrase describing it, ~<ragna~> ~<roek~>, \"the fate of the gods,\" has become familiar, by confusion with the word roekkr, \"twilight,\" in the German ~<Goeterdaemmerung~>. The wise-woman tells of the Valkyries who bring the slain warriors to support Othin and the other gods in the battle, of the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of the gods, through the wiles of Loki, of the enemies of the gods, of the summons to battle on both sides, and of the mighty struggle, till Othin is slain, and \"fire leaps high", -- had to replace "ö"s
					
					"about heaven itself\" (stanzas 31-58). But this is not all. A new and beautiful world is to rise on the ruins of the old; Baldr comes back, and \"fields unsowed bear ripened fruit\" (stanzas 59-66).\n\nThis final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments of Finnur Jonsson, Muellenhoff and others who maintain that the ~<Voluspo~> is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. It seems likely, then, that the ~<Voluspo~> was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the \"Western Isles,\" in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and yet with an imagination active enough to be touched by the vague tales of a different religion emanating from his neighbor Celts.\n\nHow much the poem was altered during the two hundred years between its composition and its first being committed to writing is largely a matter of guesswork, but, allowing for such an obvious interpolation as the catalogue of dwarfs, and for occasional lesser errors, it seems quite needless to assume such great changes as many editors do. The poem was certainly not composed to tell a story with which its early hearers were quite familiar; the lack of continuity which baffles modern readers presumably did not trouble them in the least. It is, in effect, a series of gigantic pictures, put into words with a directness and sureness which bespeak the poet of genius. It is only after the reader, with the help of the many notes, has--familiarized him self with the names and incidents involved that he can begin to understand the effect which this magnificent poem must have produced on those who not only understood but believed it.", -- had to replace "ü"s
					
					"1. Hearing I ask | from the holy races,\nFrom Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;\nThou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate\nOld tales I remember | of men long ago.\n\n2. I remember yet | the giants of yore,\nWho gave me bread | in the days gone by;\nNine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree\nWith mighty roots | beneath the mold.\n\n[1. A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify the poem, place stanzas 22, 28 and 30 before stanzas 1-20, but the arrangement in both manuscripts, followed here, seems logical. In stanza I the Volva, or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing. Evidently she be longs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic power. Holy: omitted in ~<Regius~>; the phrase \"holy races\" probably means little more than mankind in general. Heimdall: the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred to as Heimdall's sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall seems to have had various at tributes, and in the Rigsthula, wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men, a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. Rigsthula, introductory prose and note). Valfather (\"Father of the Slain\"): Othin, chief of the gods, so called because the slain warriors were brought to him at Valhall (\"Hall of the Slain\") by the Valkyries (\"Choosers of the Slain\").\n\n2. Nine worlds: the worlds of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes (Vanaheim, cf. stanza 21 and note), of the elves (Alfheim), of men (Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim, cf. stanza 47 and note), of the dark elves (Svartalfaheim), of the dead (Niflheim), and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir, cf. stanza 37 and note, but the ninth world is uncertain). The tree: the world-ash Yggdrasil, {footnote p. 4} symbolizing the universe; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 29-35 and notes, wherein Yggdrasil is described at length.]",
					
					"3. Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;\nSea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;\nEarth had not been, | nor heaven above,\nBut a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.\n\n4.

The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south\nHer right hand cast | over heaven's rim;\nNo knowledge she had | where her home should be,\nThe moon knew not | what might was his,\nThe stars knew not | where their stations were.\n\n[3. ~<Ymir~>: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 21. in this stanza as quoted in Snorri's Edda the first line runs: \"Of old was the age ere aught there was.\" ~<Yawning gap~>: this phrase, \"Ginnunga-gap,\" is sometimes used as a proper name.\n\n4. Bur's sons: Othin, Vili, and Ve. Of Bur we know only that his wife was Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn; cf. ~<Hovamol~>, 141. Vili and Ve are mentioned by name in the Eddic poems only in ~<Lokasenna~>, 26. ~<Mithgarth~> (\"Middle Dwelling\"): the world of men. ~<Leeks~>: the leek was often used as the symbol of fine growth (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, 17), and it was also supposed to have magic power (cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 7).\n\n5. Various editors have regarded this stanza as interpolated; Hoffory thinks it describes the northern summer night in which the sun does not set. Lines 3-5 are quoted by Snorri. In the manuscripts line 4 follows line 5. Regarding the sun and moon {footnote p. 5} as daughter and son of Mundilferi, cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 23 and note, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 37 and note.]",

In their dwellings at peace | they played at tables,\nOf gold no lack | did the gods then know,--\nTill thither came | up giant-maids three, Huge of might, | out of Jotunheim.\n\n[6. Possibly an interpolation, but there seems no strong reason for assuming this. Lines 1-2 are identical with lines 1-2 of stanza 9, and line 2 may have been inserted here from that later stanza.\n\n7. ~<Ithavoll~> (\"Field of Deeds\"?): mentioned only here and in stanza 60 as the meeting-place of the gods; it appears in no other connection.\n\n8. ~<Tables~>: the exact nature of this game, and whether it more closely resembled chess or checkers, has been made the subject of a 400-page treatise, Willard Fiske's \"Chess in Iceland.\" ~<Giant-maids~>: perhaps the three great Norns, corresponding to the three fates; cf. stanza 20, and note. Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and the missing passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 9-16), may have explained the \"giant-maids\" otherwise than as Norns. In ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 49, the Norms (this time \"three throngs\" in stead of simply \"three\") are spoken of as giant-maidens; {footnote p. 6} ~<Fafnismol~>, 13, indicates the existence of many lesser Norns, belonging to various races. ~<Jotunheim~>: the world of the giants.]",
					
					"9. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, | and council held,\nTo find who should raise | the race of dwarfs\nOut of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.\n\n10.

Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs, running through stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section does not begin before stanza 11. Snorri quotes practically the entire section, the names appearing in a some what changed order. ~<Brimir~> and ~<Blain~>: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested that both are names for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in stanza 37 in connection with the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat the words as common rather than proper nouns, Brimir meaning \"the bloody moisture\" and Blain being of uncertain significance.\n\n10. Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are mentioned elsewhere. It is not clear why Durin should have been singled out as authority for the list. The occasional repetitions suggest that not all the stanzas of the catalogue came from the same source. Most of the names presumably had some definite significance, as Northri, Suthri, Austri, and Vestri (\"North,\" \"South\", \"East,\" and \"West\"), {footnote p. 7} Althjof (\"Mighty Thief\"), Mjothvitnir (\"Mead-Wolf\"), Gandalf (\"Magic Elf\"), Vindalf (\"Wind Elf\"), Rathwith (\"Swift in Counsel\"), Eikinskjaldi (\"Oak Shield\"), etc., but in many cases the interpretations are sheer guesswork.]",

The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise appear in many forms. ~<Regin~>: probably not identical with Regin the son of Hreithmar, who plays an important part in the ~<Reginsmol~> and ~<Fafnismol~>, but cf. note on ~<Reginsmol~>, introductory prose.\n\n14. ~<Dvalin~>: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes to the dwarfs, probably accounting for their skill in craftsmanship, while in ~<Fafnismol~>, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the lesser Norns. The story that some of the dwarfs left the rocks and mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned, but unexplained, in Snorri's Edda; of ~<Lofar~> we know only that he was descended from these wanderers.]", -- should be "Fræg" instead of "Fraeg"

Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, Hoenir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word \"three\" in stanzas 9 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. ~<Ask~> and ~<Embla~>: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.\n\n18. ~<Hoenir~>: little is known of this god, save that he occasionally appears in the poems in company with Othin and Loki, and {footnote p. 9} that he survives the destruction, assuming in the new age the gift of prophesy (cf. stanza 63). He was given by the gods as a hostage to the Wanes after their war, in exchange for Njorth (cf. stanza 21 and note). ~<Lothur~>: apparently an older name for Loki, the treacherous but ingenious son of Laufey, whose divinity Snorri regards as somewhat doubtful. He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to the newly created pair.]", -- had to replace special characters; had to reorganize the verses, in order to keep the text within the size available for display in the Wyrmsun encyclopedia

Heith they named her | who sought their home,\nThe wide-seeing witch, | in magic wise;\nMinds she bewitched | that were moved by her magic,\nTo evil women | a joy she was.\n\n[21. This follows stanza 20 in ~<Regius~>; in the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40, and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors have attempted all sorts of rearrangements. ~<The war~>: the first war was that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir) seems to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the southern shores of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway in opposition to the worship of the older gods; hence the \"war.\" Finally the two types of divinities were worshipped in common; hence the treaty which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief among the Wanes were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who seem originally to have been water-deities. ~<I remember~>: the manuscripts have \"she remembers,\" but the Volva is apparently still speaking of her own memories, as in stanza 2. ~<Gollveig~> (\"Gold-Might\"): apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill treatment being the immediate cause of the war. Muellenhoff maintains that Gollveig is another name for Freyja. Lines 5-6, one or both of them probably interpolated, seem to symbolize the refining of gold by fire. ~<Hor~> (\"The High One\"): Othin.\n\n22. ~<Heith~> (\"Shining One\"?): a name often applied to wise women and prophetesses. The application of this stanza to Gollveig is far from clear, though the reference may be to the {footnote p. 11} magic and destructive power of gold. It is also possible that the stanza is an interpolation. Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is reciting the poem, and makes it the opening stanza, following it with stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas I ff. The text of line 2 is obscure, and has been variously emended.]", -- had to replace "ü"
					
					"23. On the host his spear | did Othin hurl,\nThen in the world | did war first come;\nThe wall that girdled | the gods was broken,\nAnd the field by the warlike | Wanes was trodden.\n\n24.

Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, | and council held,\nTo find who with venom | the air had filled,\nOr had given Oth's bride | to the giants' brood.\n\n[23. This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in the manuscripts, for the former describes the battle and the victory of the Wanes, after which the gods took council, debating whether to pay tribute to the victors, or to admit them, as was finally done, to equal rights of worship.\n\n25. Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something lost after stanza 24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to supply transitions which their hearers could generally be counted on to understand. The story referred to in stanzas 25-26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the {footnote p. 12} work was not finished in the stipulated time (cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 44, note). The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him. ~<Oth's~> ~<bride~>: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that Snorri refers to him as a man who \"went away on long journeys.\"]",

Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement of some of Othin's own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge (stanzas 27-29). Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 29. ~<The~> ~<horn~> ~<of~> ~<Heimdall~>: the Gjallarhorn (\"Shrieking Horn\"), with which Heimdall, watchman of the gods, will summon them to the last battle. Till that time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil. ~<Valfather's~> ~<pledge~>: Othin's eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange for the latter's wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin's sacrifice of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several differing versions of the story of Othin's relations with Mimir; another one, quite incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the manuscripts ~<I know~> and ~<I see~> appear as \"she knows\" and \"she sees\" (cf. note on 21).]",

The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits all of stanzas 28-34, stanza 27 being there followed by stanzas 40 and 41. ~<Regius~> indicates stanzas 28 and 29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza 22, as the second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why he has come to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for knowledge regarding his doom. Her reiterated \"would you know yet more?\" seems to mean: \"I have proved my wisdom by telling of the past and of your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise of the fate in store for you?\" ~<The Old One~>: Othin.\n\n29. The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural emendation based on Snorri's paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 20.\n\n30. This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva, rewarded by Othin for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1-29), is induced to proceed with her real prophecy (stanzas 31-66). Some editors turn the stanza into the third person, making it a narrative link. Bugge, on the other hand, puts it {footnote p. 14} after stanza 28 as the third stanza of the poem.

On all sides saw I | Valkyries assemble,\nReady to ride | to the ranks of the gods;\nSkuld bore the shield, | and Skogul rode next,\nGuth, Hild, Gondul, | and Geirskogul.\nOf Herjan's maidens | the list have ye heard,\nValkyries ready | to ride o'er the earth.\n\n32. I saw for Baldr, | the bleeding god,\nThe son of Othin, | his destiny set:\n\n[31. ~<Valkyries~>: these \"Choosers of the Slain\" (cf. stanza I, note) bring the bravest warriors killed in battle to Valhall, in order to re-enforce the gods for their final struggle. They are also called \"Wish-Maidens,\" as the fulfillers of Othin's wishes. The conception of the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of both Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, introductory note), ~<Svava~> (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 17 and note). The list of names here given may be an interpolation; a quite different list is given in ~<Grimnismol~>, 36. ~<Ranks of the gods~>: some editors regard the word thus translated as a specific place name. ~<Herjan~> (\"Leader of Hosts\"): Othin. It is worth noting that the name ~<Hild~> (\"Warrior\") is the basis of Bryn-hild (\"Warrior in Mail Coat\").\n\n32. Baldr: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the first of the great disasters to the gods. The story is fully told by Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created things, saving only the mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling {footnote p. 15} about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to he a sport for the gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally unharmed thereby. Loki, the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to Baldr's blind brother, Hoth, and guided his hand in hurling the twig. Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf. ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~>.]",
					
					"Famous and fair | in the lofty fields, | Full grown in strength | the mistletoe stood.\n\n33. From the branch which seemed | so slender and fair | Came a harmful shaft | that Hoth should hurl; | But the brother of Baldr | was born ere long, | And one night old | fought Othin's son.\n\n34. His hands he washed not, | his hair he combed not, | Till he bore to the bale-blaze | Baldr's foe. | But in Fensalir | did Frigg weep sore | For Valhall's need: | would you know yet more?\n\n35. One did I see | in the wet woods bound, | A lover of ill, | and to Loki like;\n\n[33. The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in various ways by editors, lacunae having been freely conjectured, but the manuscript version seems clear enough. ~<The~> ~<brother~> ~<of~> ~<Baldr~>: Vali, whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr's death. The day after his birth he fought and slew Hoth.\n\n34. ~<Frigg~>: Othin's wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in ~<Fensalir~> (\"the sea-halls\") symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.\n\n35. The translation here follows the ~<Regius~> version. The ~<Hauksbok~> has the same final two lines, but in place of the first {footnote p. 16} pair has, \"I know that Vali | his brother gnawed, / With his bowels then | was Loki bound.\" Many editors have followed this version of the whole stanza or have included these two lines, often marking them as doubtful, with the four from ~<Regius~>. After the murder of Baldr, the gods took Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels of his son Narfi, who had just been torn to pieces by Loki's other son, Vali. A serpent was fastened above Loki's head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki's wife, ~<Sigyn~>, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever the basin was full, and she went away to empty it, then the venom fell on Loki again, till the earth shook with his struggles. \"And there he lies bound till the end.\" Cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, concluding prose.]",

Stanzas 36-39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the giants (36), the dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess Hel (38-39). The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits stanzas 36 and 37. ~<Regius~> unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. ~<Slith~> (\"the Fearful\"): a river in the giants' home. The \"swords and daggers\" may represent the icy cold.\n\n37. ~<Nithavellir~> (\"the Dark Fields\"): a home of the dwarfs. Perhaps the word should be \"Nithafjoll\" (\"the Dark Crags\"). ~<Sindri~>: the great worker in gold among the dwarfs. ~<Okolnir~> {footnote p. 17} (\"the Not Cold\"): possibly a volcano. ~<Brimir~>: the giant (possibly Ymir) out of whose blood, according to stanza 9, the dwarfs were made; the name here appears to mean simply the leader of the dwarfs.]",
					
					"38. A hall I saw, | far from the sun,\nOn Nastrond it stands, | and the doors face north,\nVenom drops | through the smoke-vent down,\nFor around the walls | do serpents wind.\n\n39.

Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the ~<Hauksbok~> version. Snorri quotes stanzas 39, 39, 40 and 41, though not consecutively. ~<Nastrond~> (\"Corpse-Strand\"): the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess Hel. Here the wicked undergo tortures. ~<Smoke~> ~<vent~>: the phrase gives a picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof serving instead of a chimney.\n\n39. The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is presumably an interpolation, and is lacking in most of the late, paper manuscripts. Some editors, however, have called lines 1-3 the remains of a full. stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines 4-5 the remains of another. The stanza depicts the torments of the two worst classes of criminals known to Old Norse morality--oath-breakers and murderers. ~<Nithhogg~> (\"the Dread Biter\"): the dragon that lies beneath the ash Yggdrasil and gnaws at its roots, thus symbolizing the destructive elements in the universe; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 32, 35. ~<The wolf~>: presumably the wolf Fenrir, one of the children of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha (the others being Mithgarthsorm and the goddess Hel), who was chained by the gods with the marvelous chain Gleipnir, fashioned by a dwarf \"out of six things: the {footnote p. 18} noise of a cat's step, the beards of women, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath of fishes, and the spittle of birds.\" The chaining of Fenrir cost the god Tyr his right hand; cf. stanza 44.]",

The ~<Hauksbok~> version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain stanza (44), and puts stanzas 40 and 41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza begins the account of the final struggle itself. ~<The giantess~>: her name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in ~<Grimnismol~>, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess and the wolf Fenrir are the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom steals the sun, the second the moon. Some scholars naturally see here an eclipse myth.\n\n41. In the third line many editors omit the comma after \"sun,\" and put one after \"soon,\" making the two lines run: \"Dark grows the sun | in summer soon, / Mighty storms--\" etc. Either phenomenon in summer would be sufficiently striking.\n\n42. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 42 and 43 stand between stanzas 44 and 38. ~<Eggther~>: this giant, who seems to be the watchman of the giants, as Heimdall is that of the gods and Surt of the dwellers in the fire-world, is not mentioned elsewhere in {footnote p. 19} the poems. ~<Fjalar~>, the cock whose crowing wakes the giants for the final struggle.]",

Brothers shall fight | and fell each other,\nAnd sisters' sons | shall kinship stain;\n\n[43. ~<Gollinkambi~> (\"Gold-Comb\"): the cock who wakes the gods and heroes, as Fjalar does the giants. ~<The~> ~<rust-red~> ~<bird~>: the name of this bird, who wakes the people of Hel's domain, is nowhere stated.\n\n44. This is a refrain-stanza. In ~<Regius~> it appears in full only at this point, but is repeated in abbreviated form before stanzas 50 and 59. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version the full stanza comes first between stanzas 35 and 42, then, in abbreviated form, it occurs four times: before stanzas 45, 50, 55, and 59. In the ~<Hauksbok~> line 3 runs: \"Farther I see and more can say.\" ~<Garm~>: the dog who guards the gates of Hel's kingdom; cf. Baldrs Draumar, 2 ff., and ~<Grimnismol~>, 44. ~<Gniparhellir~> (\"the Cliff-Cave\"): the entrance to the world of the dead. ~<The~> ~<wolf~>: Fenrir; cf. stanza 39 and note.\n\n45. From this point on through stanza 57 the poem is quoted by Snorri, stanza 49 alone being omitted. There has been much discussion as to the status of stanza 45. Lines 4 and 5 look like an interpolation. After line 5 the ~<Hauksbok~> has a line running: \"The world resounds, the witch is flying.\" Editors have arranged these seven lines in various ways, with lacunae freely indicated. ~<Sisters'~> ~<sons~>: in all Germanic countries the relations between uncle and nephew were felt to be particularly close.]",

Othin embalmed the head, and by magic gave it the power of speech, thus making Mimir's noted wisdom always available. of course this story does not fit with that underlying the references to Mimir in stanzas 27 and 29. ~<The~> ~<kinsman~> ~<of~> ~<Surt~>: the wolf {footnote p. 21} Fenrir, who slays Othin in the final struggle; cf. stanza 53.

As quoted by Snorri the first line of this stanza runs: \"Fares Othin's son | to fight with the wolf.\" ~<Sigfather~> (\"Father of Victory\"): Othin. His son, Vithar, is the silent god, famed chiefly for his great shield, and his strength, which is little less than Thor's. He survives the destruction. ~<The~> ~<giant's~> ~<son~>: Fenrir.\n\n55.

Snorri's description of this second hall is based on ~<Voluspo~>, 38, which he quotes, and perhaps that stanza properly belongs after 64.\n\n65.

					"~<Hovamol~> ~<-~> ~<The Ballad of the High One~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThis poem follows the ~<Voluspo~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, but is preserved in no other manuscript. The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and two lines of stanza 84 appear in one of the sagas.\n\nIn its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other of the Eddic poems. Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened seems to have been somewhat as follows. There existed from very early times a collection of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical proverbs were to Solomon. This collection, which presumably was always elastic in extent, was known as \"The High One's Words,\" and forms the basis of the present poem. To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin. Thus a catalogue of runes, or charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from those comprising the main collection. Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter to insert new stanzas almost at will. This curious miscellany is what we now have as the ~<Hovamol~>.\n\nFive separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the ~<Hovamol~> proper (stanzas 1-80), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life; (2) the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (stanzas 111-138), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specific ally addressed to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing's daughter (stanzas 96-102), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness of women in general (stanzas 81-95), which probably crept into the poem first, and then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin got the mead of poetry--the draught which gave him the gift of tongues--from the maiden Gunnloth (stanzas 103-110). There is also a brief passage (stanzas 139 146) telling how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the ~<Ljothatal~>, and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason.", -- had to condense the two first "titles" into one line, instead of being in separate lines
					
					"It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this. Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts of it may have originated at a relatively late period. Probably, however, most of its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how or when they first became associated.\n\nIt seems all but meaningless to talk about \"interpolations\" in a poem which has developed almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and ends. The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main divisions of the poem distinct.\n\nFew gnomic collections in the world's literary history present sounder wisdom more tersely expressed than the Hovamol. Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry. If it presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty, truth, and unfaltering courage.\n\n1. Within the gates | ere a man shall go,\n(Full warily let him watch,)\nFull long let him look about him;\nFor little he knows | where a foe may lurk,\nAnd sit in the seats within.\n\n2. Hail to the giver! | a guest has come;\nWhere shall the stranger sit?\nSwift shall he be who, | with swords shall try\nThe proof of his might to make.\n\n[1. This stanza is quoted by Snorri, the second line being omitted in most of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~> manuscripts.\n\n2. Probably the first and second lines had originally nothing to do with the third and fourth, the last two not referring to host or guest, but to the general danger of backing one's views with the sword.]",

Water and towels | and welcoming speech\nShould he find who comes, to the feast;\nIf renown he would get, | and again be greeted,\nWisely and well must he act.\n\n5. Wits must he have | who wanders wide,\nBut all is easy at home;\nAt the witless man | the wise shall wink\nWhen among such men he sits.\n\n6. A man shall not boast | of his keenness of mind,\nBut keep it close in his breast;\nTo the silent and wise | does ill come seldom\nWhen he goes as guest to a house;\n(For a faster friend | one never finds\nThan wisdom tried and true.)\n\n7. The knowing guest | who goes to the feast,\nIn silent attention sits;\nWith his ears he hears, | with his eyes he watches,\nThus wary are wise men all.\n\n[6. Lines 5 and 6 appear to have been added to the stanza.]",
					
					"8. Happy the one | who wins for himself\nFavor and praises fair;\nLess safe by far | is the wisdom found\nThat is hid in another's heart.\n\n9. Happy the man | who has while he lives\nWisdom and praise as well,\nFor evil counsel | a man full oft\nHas from another's heart.\n\n10. A better burden | may no man bear\nFor wanderings wide than wisdom;\nIt is better than wealth | on unknown ways,\nAnd in grief a refuge it gives.\n\n11. A better burden | may no man bear\nFor wanderings wide than wisdom;\nWorse food for the journey | he brings not afield\nThan an over-drinking of ale.\n\n12. Less good there lies | than most believe\nIn ale for mortal men;\nFor the more he drinks | the less does man\nOf his mind the mastery hold.\n\n[12. Some editors have combined this stanza in various ways with the last two lines of stanza it, as in the manuscript the first two lines of the latter are abbreviated, and, if they belong there at all, are presumably identical with the first two lines of stanza 10.]",
					
					"13. Over beer the bird | of forgetfulness broods,\nAnd steals the minds of men;\nWith the heron's feathers | fettered I lay\nAnd in Gunnloth's house was held.\n\n14.

The son of a king | shall be silent and wise,\nAnd bold in battle as well;\nBravely and gladly | a man shall go,\nTill the day of his death is come.\n\n16. The sluggard believes | he shall live forever,\nIf the fight he faces not;\nBut age shall not grant him | the gift of peace,\nThough spears may spare his life.\n\n17. The fool is agape | when he comes to the feast,\nHe stammers or else is still;\nBut soon if he gets | a drink is it seen\nWhat the mind of the man is like.\n\n[13. ~<The heron~>: the bird of forgetfulness, referred to in line 1. ~<Gunnloth~>: the daughter of the giant Suttung, from whom Othin won the mead of poetry. For this episode see stanzas 104-110.\n\n14. ~<Fjalar~>: apparently another name for Suttung. This stanza, and probably 13, seem to have been inserted as illustrative.]",

The greedy man, | if his mind be vague,\nWill eat till sick he is;\nThe vulgar man, | when among the wise,\nTo scorn by his belly is brought.\n\n21. The herds know well | when home they shall fare,\nAnd then from the grass they go;\nBut the foolish man | his belly's measure\nShall never know aright.\n\n22. A paltry man | and poor of mind\nAt all things ever mocks;\nFor never he knows, | what he ought to know,\nThat he is not free from faults.\n\n23.

An ignorant man | thinks that all he knows,\nWhen he sits by himself in a corner;\nBut never what answer | to make he knows,\nWhen others with questions come.\n\n27. A witless man, | when he meets with men,\nHad best in silence abide;\nFor no one shall find | that nothing he knows,\nIf his mouth is not open too much.\n(But a man knows not, | if nothing he knows,\nWhen his mouth has been open too much.)\n\n28.

This stanza follows stanza 63 in the manuscript, but there are marks therein indicating the transposition.\n65. The manuscript indicates no lacuna (lines I and 2). Many editors have filled out the stanza with two lines from late paper manuscripts, the passage running:\n\n\t\t\"A man must be watchful | and wary as well,\n\t\tAnd fearful of trusting a friend.\"\n]",

Among Fitjung's sons | saw I well-stocked folds,--\nNow bear they the beggar's staff;\n\n[73-74. These seven lines are obviously a jumble. The two lines of stanza 73 not only appear out of place, but the verse form is unlike that of the surrounding stanzas. In 74, the second line is clearly interpolated, and line I has little enough connection with lines 3, 4 and 5. It looks as though some compiler (or copyist) had inserted here various odds and ends for which he could find no better place.\n\n75. The word \"gold\" in line 2 is more or less conjectural, the manuscript being obscure. The reading in line 4 is also doubtful.]",

This stanza is certainly in bad shape, and probably out of place here. Its reference to runes as magic signs suggests that it properly belongs in some list of charms like the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165). The stanza-form is so irregular as to show either that something has been lost or that there have been interpolations. The manuscript indicates no lacuna; Gering fills out the assumed gap as follows:\n\n\t\t\"Certain is that which is sought from runes,\n\t\tThe runes--,\" etc.\n]", -- had to make more verses fit within single lines, to make the page fit within the window
					
					"His pride will wax, but his wisdom never,\nStraight forward he fares in conceit.\n\n~<* * *~>\n\n81. Give praise to the day at evening, | to a woman on her pyre,\nTo a weapon which is tried, | to a maid at wed lock,\nTo ice when it is crossed, | to ale that is drunk.\n\n82. When the gale blows hew wood, | in fair winds seek the water;\nSport with maidens at dusk, | for day's eyes are many;\nFrom the ship seek swiftness, | from the shield protection,\nCuts from the sword, | from the maiden kisses.\n\n83. By the fire drink ale, | over ice go on skates;\nBuy a steed that is lean, | and a sword when tarnished,\n\n[81. With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes to Malahattr. What has happened seems to have been something like this. Stanza 80 introduces the idea of man's love for woman. Consequently some reciter or compiler (or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas concerning the ways of women. Thus stanza 80 would account for the introduction of stanzas 81 and 82, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza 83 in with them. Stanza 84 suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed--again with a change of verse-form--by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas 85-90). Then, after a few more stanzas on love in the regular measure of the ~<Hovamol~> (stanza 91-9s), is introduced, by way of illustration, Othin's story of his {footnote p. 46} adventure with Billing's daughter (stanzas 96-102). Some such process of growth, whatever its specific stages may have been, must be assumed to account for the curious chaos of the whole passage from stanza 81 to stanza 102.]",

					"~<Alvissmol - The Ballad of Alvis~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nNo better summary of the Alvissmol can be given than Gering's statement that \"it is a versified chapter from the skaldic Poetics.\" The narrative skeleton, contained solely in stanzas 1-8 and in 35, is of the slightest; the dwarf Alvis, desirous of marrying Thor's daughter, is compelled by the god to answer a number of questions to test his knowledge. That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called \"in each of all the worlds,\" but there is no apparent significance in the fact that the gods call the earth one thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions, or \"kennings.\" Concerning the use of these \"kennings\" in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory note to the ~<Hymiskvitha~>.\n\nMogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning it to the period of \"the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.\" It appears to have been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,--Thor's questions, for instance, are neatly balanced in pairs,--and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction, but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous poetry. Finnur Jonsson's attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence, which is by no means incompatible with Mogk's theory (cf. introductory note to the ~<Rigsthula~>).\n\nThe poem is found only in ~<Regius~>, where it follows the Thrymskvitha. Snorri quotes stanzas 2c, and 30, the manuscripts of the ~<Prose Edda~> giving the name of the poem as ~<Alvissmol~>, ~<Alsvinnsmol~> or ~<Olvismol~>. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission, although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily as to defy detection.\n\nThe translation of the many synonyms presents, of course,", -- had to fuse the title and subtitle into one line, to make the page fit
					
					"unusual difficulties, particularly as many of the Norse words can be properly rendered in English only by more or less extended phrases. I have kept to the original meanings as closely as I could without utterly destroying the metrical structure.\n\n~<Alvis spake:~>\n1. \"Now shall the bride | my benches adorn,\nAnd homeward haste forthwith;\nEager for wedlock | to all shall I seem,\nNor at home shall they rob me of rest.\"\n\n~<Thor spake:~>\n2. \"What, pray, art thou? | Why so pale round the nose?\nBy the dead hast thou lain of late?\nTo a giant like | dost thou look, methinks;\nThou wast not born for the bride.\"\n\n~<Alvis spake:~>\n3. \"Alvis am I, | and under the earth\nMy home 'neath the rocks I have;\n\n[1. ~<Alvis~> (\"All-Knowing\"): a dwarf, not elsewhere mentioned. The manuscript nowhere indicates the speakers' name. The bride in question is Thor's daughter; Thruth (\"Might\") is the only daughter of his whose name is recorded, and she does not appear elsewhere in the poems. Her mother was Sif, Thor's wife, whereas the god's sons were born of a giantess. ~<Benches~>: cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, 15 and note.\n\n2. The dwarfs, living beyond the reach of the sun, which was fatal to them (cf. stanzas 16 and 35), were necessarily pale. Line 3 is, of course, ironical.\n\n3. ~<Wagon-guider~>: Thor, who travels habitually on his goat drawn wagon. Bugge changes \"Vagna vets\" to \"Vapna verths,\" {footnote p. 185} rendering the line \"I am come to seek the cost of the weapons.\" In either case, Alvis does not as yet recognize Thor.]", -- had to replace "þ"

Apparently the gods promised Thor's daughter in marriage to Alvis during her father's absence, perhaps as a reward for some craftsmanship of his (cf. Bugge's suggestion as to stanza 3). The text of line 4 is most uncertain.\n\n5. ~<Hero~>: ironically spoken; Alvis takes Thor for a tramp, the god's uncouth appearance often leading to such mistakes; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 6. Line 4 is a trifle uncertain; some editors alter the wording to read \"What worthless woman bore thee?\"\n\n6. ~<Vingthor~> (\"Thor the Hurler\"): cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 1. ~<Sithgrani~> (\"Long-Beard\"): Othin.]",

Voluspo, 2 and note. Many editors follow this stanza with one spoken by Alvis, found in late paper manuscripts, as follows: \"Ask then, Vingthor, since eager thou art / The lore of the dwarf to learn; / Oft have I fared in the nine worlds all, / And wide is my wisdom of each.\"\n\n10. ~<Men~>, etc.: nothing could more clearly indicate the author's mythological inaccuracy than his confusion of the inhabitants of the nine worlds. Men (dwellers in Mithgarth) appear in each of Alvis's thirteen answers; so do the gods (Asgarth) and the giants (Jotunheim). The elves (Alfheim) appear in eleven {footnote p. 187} answers, the Wanes (Vanaheim) in nine, and the dwarfs (who occupied no special world, unless one identifies them with the dark elves of Svartalfaheim) in seven. The dwellers \"in hell\" appear in six stanzas; the phrase probably refers to the world of the dead, though Mogk thinks it may mean the dwarfs. In stanzas where the gods are already listed appear names else where applied only to them,--\"holy ones,\" \"sons of the gods\" and \"high ones,\"--as if these names meant beings of a separate race. \"Men\" appears twice in the same stanza, and so do the giants, if one assumes that they are \"the sons of Suttung.\" Altogether it is useless to pay much attention to the mythology of Alvis's replies.]", -- had to fit more verses in a single for it to fit into the window

The {footnote p. 189} sun \"deceives\" him because, like the other dwarfs living under ground, he cannot live in its light, and always fears lest sunrise may catch him unaware. The sun's rays have power to turn the dwarfs into stone, and the giantess Hrimgerth meets a similar fate (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 30).
