					"~<The Gnomes of the Saline Mountains~>\n\n~<A Fantastic Narrative~>\n\n~<I.~>\n\nThough rather early in the morning, the well-known esplanade along the beautiful Traunsee at Gmunden, surrounded by green-decked Saline Mountains, was already thronged to overflowing with eager-looking sightseers, watching excitedly the completion of the grandstands which were now being erected for the great event of the day.\n\nSpecial trains arrived hourly from Ischel, Aussee, Hallstadt, and other mountain resorts of prominence, and the excitement seemed to increase each moment more and more.\n\nHumdrum life was thrown aside by young and old; everyone looked on expectantly, reviewing the grandstands, the tourists, and everything new around them.",
					
					"Fair-browed girls robed in spotless white muslin, garlanded with flowers and bright with rosy badges in honor of the occasion, were seen here and there, while their eyes sparkled and their lips drank from the cup of happiness, enjoying life and the blessing of being young.\n\nThe constantly increasing throng of summer visitors and tourists from all parts of the globe, speaking different languages and wearing outlandish clothes, made up a bewildering picture, while the July sun beamed down upon them, and over lake and green-decked mountain-tops.\n\nThe much talked of floral regatta of 1910 was not to take place until five, but by one o'clock the grandstands near the water, hardly completed, began to fill rapidly with the elite of Viennese society. These floral festivals, which had been so popular in previous years, were to be surpassed in artistic splendor and brilliant originality by today's display of picturesque effects, and symbolism of national life.\n\nMembers of the highest nobility had consented to take leading parts in the regatta, which was under the protectorate of the Archduke Victor. Many celebrities of the musical world, living",
					
					"there in their beautiful cottages, were seen quietly taking their seats. The great bare mountain \"Traunstein\" seemed to smile down on them from his aerial height in friendly approval; they were no strangers to him, these music giants, but rather belonged to his enthusiastic admirers.\n\nEvery spring they came to him, seeking relaxation for their over-strained nerves, and every fall, when his bald head began to be covered with a cap of snow, they went home full of elasticity and creative power, often bringing along conceptions of masterpieces which were later to fill the entire musical world with admiration. No wonder then, that the bald-headed old fellow up there so high above his neighbors looked down so proudly upon them.\n\nLoud blasts of trumpets in the distance announced to the patiently awaiting throng the approach of a long line of richly decorated boats. Archduke Victor, leading the procession, sat in the stern of his boat, which was gorgeously arrayed to represent a bower of field roses. He opened the festival by throwing red carnations into the water as far as his hand could reach. Next",
					
					"came the customary exchange of greetings among the Austrian nobility, whose elaborately decorated boats were stationed on both sides of the lake. At their approach, the orchestra on the esplanade burst forth with the National anthem of Austria, and the spectators applauded frantically.\n\nRight and left, as far as the eye could see, the shimmering surface of the lake, with its little, gently splashing wavelets, was covered with brightly colored crafts, every one an unique marvel of its kind.\n\nThere came splashing along a huge Easter egg, made up of lilies of the valley; here a pagoda of large sunflowers called forth the admiration of the delighted sightseers.\n\nFrom the opposite shore there came floating a half opened Nautilus, out of which a green-clad naiad cast coquettishly her golden net, trying to catch some inexperienced young fish in her golden meshes. Nearby sailed a sleeping beauty (though rather wide awake) embowered enchantingly in clusters of American Beauties, looking in all directions for her enchanted Prince to appear and make ardent love to her.",
					
					"Suddenly there came, as if by magic, a gondola from the other side of the lake; it was gorgeously decorated, shining brightly in the brilliant afternoon sun. This floating work of art was made of lotus flowers, over which a canopy of glittering, diaphanous material was hanging, presumably as a suitable background for a lady now the cynosure of all eyes. She was of such entrancing beauty that all who beheld her sat spellbound and actually forgot to applaud, according to the customary greeting to newcomers, scarcely knowing which to admire first; the magnificent craft, so artistically constructed, or the dazzling apparition within.\n\nAmazed and speechless, the distinguished gathering gazed at her. \"Who is she?\" they whispered to each other. Her name was not on the list of nobilities. Nobody knew anything about her, but she was gorgeously dressed, her costume representing that of Cleopatra, made up of pale green crepe de chine, covered with little amorettes of silver pearls, which hung loosely in artistic folds about the luxurious outlines of her bewitching form. Long flaxen hair, artistically arranged, set off with diamond sparks, fell about",
					
					"her, and shone like molten gold in the setting sun. It was supposed to be a real reproduction, according to ancient pictures, of the flirtatious Queen of Egypt, seen in the art galleries of Florence, Genoa and Rome. Her large black eyes held a singular fascination in their sparkling depths, which if once looked into, fastened themselves upon the imagination of man to be forgotten no more.\n\nAt the sight of all these splendors amid such exclusive surroundings, she looked with a frightened stare into space, as if she were a newcomer, a stranger in this atmosphere of wealth and distinction. Her features were rigid and white, and she seemed fascinated, dumb with admiration at the sight of the splendid surroundings. For this reason, she had failed to notice the sensation her beauty had aroused among the masculine sightseers.\n\nA slender man, with deep set eyes, and thin and bloodless lips tightly pressed together, sat in an unpretentious little boat a short distance away, murmuring grimly unintelligible words to himself. She caught sight of him and sent him a friendly glance and a smile similar to the greeting",
					
					"of well-known friends. He did not lose sight of her for a moment, but almost devoured her with his eyes.\n\nWith feverish eagerness he followed her every movement, knitting his brows threateningly when any boat of the Viennese \"Jeunesse doree\" came with admiring curiosity too near to her's. In his jealous rage he felt like driving all of them from the spot.\n\nHe began to reproach himself for having yielded to her cajoling entreaty to be allowed to take part in the festivity.\n\n\"Miserable fops,\" he murmured contemptuously, as he contemplated the admiring men with a scornful sneer. \"I loathe the sight of all these nobodies,\" he grumblingly soliloquized.\n\nMany of them, in fact, had nothing to boast about. Many of these so-called nobles in addition to a noble name, combined magnificent poverty and an abhorrence for honest work; they acquired a heap of debts and their inherited estates were often in the hands of unscrupulous usurers, or mortgaged to the last cent, while the sneering one had money in such abundance that he could",
					
					"have purchased patents of nobility for an entire regiment, and still have a reserve revenue from his unfathomable gold mine in South Africa. His finances would have allowed him the luxury of such a woman-although it must be whispered he had a wife in England, divorced some people asserted.",
					
					"~<II.~>\n\nIt was seven o'clock; the great animated festival drew near its end. At a given signal from the master of ceremonies, the music on the esplanade stopped; a hush fell on the distinguished gathering.\n\nArchduke Victor, in his own exalted person, was to award the stipulated prizes to the boats of most artistic and original designs.\n\nThe fanfares sounded gayly over land and sea, and all the boats small and large ranged themselves in a semi-circle about the illustrious judge. The first prize, a silver statuette of the Goddess Hebe, was awarded to the fascinating princess of Egypt.\n\nWith a flourish of trumpets, and amid shouts of applause from the enthusiastic throng, all looked around for the boat of the prize winner. But there was no sign of it anywhere, nor was the single boat of the slender Englishman to be seen any more.",
					
					"At a given signal from Mr. Ogden, the artistically constructed little boat had quietly turned about, and the two, availing themselves of the general excitement over the awarding of prizes, had quietly slipped away behind the neighboring piers, where the palatial home of the unfortunate Archduke Johann Salvatore is to be seen. He is better known to the outer world under the pseudonym \"Johann Orth.\"\n\nHis sorrowing mother is still seen by passers-by sitting near the window with expectant eyes waiting for the lost son to return.\n\nThe brilliant floral festival enacted on the lake was at an end. On the esplanade were still seen groups of excited spectators discussing with great animation once more, the singular disappearance of the wonderful little boat that was fortunate enough to win the first prize and whose occupants disappeared without claiming that distinction. Others lost no time in entering the brightly illuminated cafes in the vicinity of the esplanade to refresh themselves after the excitement of the grand event.\n\nOn the eastern horizon a thin, fleecy scarf of clouds was visible and the silvery moon with all",
					
					"her sparkling companions had just come out to beam upon the scene. The West was a single shrine of beryl, whereon ruby flakes of vapor seemed to float through the universe.\n\nMeanwhile the much-admired boat was silently gliding over the surface of the gently splashing waves. The half reclining form of the fascinating woman seemed in the amber moonlight to resemble that of Aphrodite, as if risen from the waves and in a wanton mood, anxious to make a trial performance all by herself of her incontestable power over the other sex.\n\n\"Am I really so fascinating? Did those admiring glances tell the tale of my triumph?\" she murmured with a happy smile to herself, looking askance at the boat alongside her's, where her jealous admirer sat with gloomy eyes, consumed by jealousy.\n\nMr. Ogden, to whom she owed all this splendor, regarded with unconcealed displeasure the day's proceedings. He reproached himself for having yielded to her entreaty. She had begged and coaxed him so much, until he gave his consent, then he ordered the decoration of the boat.",
					
					"Her costume was especially ordered from the most expensive tailor according to ancient pictures of the Egyptian Queen. Ogden undoubtedly wanted her to be the most striking figure on the lake.\n\nAnd now! Was he really jealous because she was the most admired, the most beautiful? \"Jealous? Ho! ho!\"\n\nShe shrugged her white shoulders with a contemptuous smile.\n\nDid he really think that she loved him? \"Phew!\"\n\nShe had only accepted his ardent devotion to learn what riches and luxury really meant, for which she had an uncontrollable longing, a longing that almost devoured her! Night and day she thought of it, how to get rich.\n\nThe aggressive poverty in which she had passed her earlier days, was too hideous to dwell upon; she could not think of it without a shudder. The idea of being poor again took her breath away. How could she ever have consented to become the wife of a man who was poor? \"Handsome but poor! What an anomaly!\" she said in an undertone,",
					
					"smiling sarcastically.\n\nWith bitter envy and scorn in her painfully contracted heart, she saw the rich but most ugly looking women rolling by in their elegant automobiles disdainfully glancing at her and her poor outfit. Often enough when she was working,-engaged in the performance of her household duties in the two small dark rooms of a tenement house, without pure air, without light to brighten her beautiful face, she cursed everything. This hovel her home! And she had the priceless gift of beauty! She made up her mind not to stand it any longer.\n\nThe day came when she was seized by such a consuming desire to go in pursuit of pleasure, to wear elegant, stylish clothes and feel the admiring glances of the other sex resting upon her, that meeting Mr. Ogden by accident and dazzled by his wealth, captivated by his costly presents, she accepted his proposal to go with him forgetting everything, even the sacred duty of a mother.",
					
					"~<III.~>\n\nThe much-admired little boat was now approaching the narrow bay which is only two minutes distance from Gmunden. There stood the spick and span victoria of Mr. Ogden; the two black horses attached to it struck out sparks of fire with their impatient hoofs. The tall Englishman who had distanced her, stood there waiting. The moment he caught sight of her bewitching face, his eyes sparkled and smiling sweetly at her, helped her tenderly out of the boat.\n\nThe sun had just gone down behind a fleecy cloud and kindled a volcano, from whose silver-rimmed crater fiery rays of scarlet shot up almost to the clear zenith. She looked fatigued and closed her eyes for a moment. Now she caught sight of him and smiled, allowing him to take her away-\n\nTenderly kissing her hand, he led her to the carriage, lifted her carefully in and wrapped a costly cloak, which was laying there, around the",
					
					"enchanting form he so adored.\n\nShe did not speak, but sat by his side in silence. He gazed at her several times and then gave the order to start. The carriage set off at a rapid gait.\n\nThe light of day was rapidly failing. Day and night seemed to join hands in a twilight mystery; black clouds were now piling up threateningly on the western horizon. A heavy gust scattered the thick aggressive atmosphere. Flying leaves were lifted up in the air as if by magic, and went through the wildest dances to the piping and howling of the storm, which now commenced to rage in all its fury, while voices of sinister shadows in the air, seemed to hold intercourse with others in the distance.\n\nIn these high mountainous regions a few moments suffice to turn a smiling landscape into a cheerless dripping desert. Claps of thunder and flashes of lightning followed each other at brief intervals. The rain now fell in torrents and the howling storm whipped the green lake whose wavelets had been so gently splashing half an hour ago.",
					
					"~<IV.~>\n\nDuring the events described in the preceding chapter, a man still in the glow of youth was walking through the valley surrounded by lofty saline cliffs, in this howling storm, while clouds of shrivelled leaves danced above his head. He did not mind the dreary desolation around him.\n\nHis face, naturally strong with manly beauty, was now pale and haggard, showing unmistakable traces of a great sorrow. His large intelligent eyes were now sunk deep in their sockets. A nervous restlessness made him shiver, and his pale cheeks gathered only a little color when an obstinate cough threatened to rend his suffering breast asunder.\n\nHis coat betrayed the elegant cut of the fashionable tailor, but it was now old and worn, and hung loosely about his emaciated form. He looked like a teacher on whom fortune had persistently turned her back.\n\nHe carried in his hands a thick book, carefully wrapped up in a handkerchief, which he clasped",
					
					"tightly almost tenderly to his breast, as if afraid at any moment it might escape or drop out of his hands. This idea made him tremble. It was indeed his only source of income; by the aid of this valuable book he had already earned many a gold piece in the Tyrolian and Styrian mountains.\n\nHis humorous lectures had been received with great approbation in different hotels frequented by many foreign tourists. And still, his earnings were not sufficient to support him and his motherless child, pretty little Marie, whom he had left in the meantime with a family of friends in Dresden. Every silver groschen he had earned was for the support of his child.\n\nHe had come all the way from Hallstadt, and this long walk had exhausted his strength considerably; and his heart was sick and heavy. Now he felt a frightful nervousness, fearing not to be able to reach in time the hotel where he was announced to deliver his humorous lecture.\n\nHe walked as quickly as he could to the farther end of the valley, where he expected to see a clearing in the forest, and an open road to the hotel. But on all sides he met high, unfamiliar",
					
					"cliffs. Apprehension fell over him like an icy rain.\n\n\"Can I have lost my way?\" he murmured, breathing heavily, while great beads of perspiration broke out on his forehead.\n\nIn an hour's time he was supposed to be at the Mountain View Hotel, and now.... He looked helplessly around. Darkness began to fall, contesting every inch of ground with retreating daylight. His teeth were chattering with a cold chill, when he set out to find another opening.\n\nThe continuous excitement of this wandering from one hotel to another, the consuming sorrow, the bleeding wound in his heart, had gradually undermined his constitution, originally none too strong, and now this wearing cough, the insidious fever!... \"How upset I feel; it's the peculiar atmosphere,\" he said to himself. At the same time he remembered that the entertainment he proposed to offer this evening, was not sufficiently furnished with witty epigrams and bons mots. So, bowing and smiling to an imaginary audience of cosmopolitan taste, he began to rehearse his lecture as he walked on, sharpening the humour",
					
					"and adding some popular Austrian witticisms in vogue as trump cards.\n\nSuddenly he looked up and saw a dark cloud threatening down upon him. Heavy gusts of wind commenced to bend the tops of the high, impenetrable trees. The songs of the mocking birds rang from the cedars in the distance in his ear and startled him.\n\nHe stopped in alarm and looked distractedly around him. Where was he? He could not make out. In the marshy places the fireflies were seen, wandering about and looking in the distance like malicious eyes of wicked sprites.\n\nThere was no longer any doubt, he had taken an entirely wrong direction.\n\nTrembling with excitement, fearing delay, he rushed back to look for the right path, while his hot breath grated audibly on his weak lungs. A fearful storm was gathering, whispering and sobbing like complaining, frightened witches now whirling the leaves into the air vehemently as if driven by the furies of Hades.\n\nA cold shudder ran through his fevered frame. He gazed in helpless despair up and down, not",
					
					"knowing where to turn, while the rain poured down in torrents, soaking him from head to foot, and the centuries old tree-tops groaned and moaned like lost souls in Dante's Inferno. Now everything began to swim around him. Nature was in an uproar and bluster. Every little glowworm seemed to his frightened eyes to grow to gigantic proportions dancing wildly about.\n\nSharp flashes of lightning lit up the Traunstein ever and anon and seemed to come nearer and nearer, as if trying to march straight down upon him. He wanted to retreat, but could not move; there was a dark mist before his eyes. Uttering a piercing cry, he fell to the ground in a heap because the big monster kept on advancing.\n\nWith a tremendous crash, the great mountain burst apart and a whole troop of tiny, little mountain gnomes came out, dancing grotesquely like sprites of another world.\n\nThey were garbed in white vestments, like fleecy vapors, with brazen girdles which seemed to be sunbeams, and a cloudy stuff supposed to be mantles hung loosely around their diminutive forms. With bare feet they pattered down upon",
					
					"him. As soon as they caught sight of him they commenced to giggle, swarming around him in great merriment. And then they put their ludicrous little heads together and pointed at him with contempt, whispering tales in falsetto tones to each other, which he could not understand. But he saw by the glare of their twinkling little eyes that they meant him, that they touched on something in his past life.\n\nBy and by they became bolder and touched his wet clothes; some of the older ones bent down to him and whispered malicious tales about his wife into his ears. He groaned aloud. \"It is a lie! I don't believe a word of it!\" he screamed, cursing the whole deceitful band. In his indignation he tried to rise several times in order to drive them away-down into the foaming stream, or back into their mountain riff; but he could not move; his feet seemed to be fastened to the very ground as if paralyzed or chained to earth. They whispered once more the name of his wife with scornful laughter, and passed on over hills and valleys dancing merrily.",
					
					"Suddenly a bright light shone about him, illuminating the marshy waters; invisible choirs were singing sweetly, as if angels were descending from heaven. His eyes dilated as he saw a procession of tiny elves passing him, carrying little lighted tapers in their diminutive hands. In their midst he saw his dear mother stretching out her arms longingly towards him.\n\nTears came to his eyes. The dear face! He wanted to run to her, embrace her, but could not stir. A cry of horror broke from his trembling lips when the fair Siren so fatal to his life stood before him, intervening and trying to ensnare him again with the fascination of her glittering eyes, her bewitching smile, speaking to him of love and devotion which he believed again.\n\nHe listened to her; and a ray of happiness and delight filled his love-sick heart. She comes back to him! She loves only him! And unheeding the beseeching beckoning of his anxious mother, whose tortured heart writhed and bled for her suffering son, he hastened on with the enticing Siren,-where to, he did not know.\n\nSuddenly they stood before a deep precipice; darkness surrounded them, and the old trees",
					
					"commenced to sigh and moan and bend down upon them. Six shadowy forms with blazing torches appeared upon the scene carrying a coffin. Just in front of him the lid opened and the pale waxen face of his dead mother met his frightened eyes. He screamed aloud with horror. He had broken that noble heart, he had killed the best of mothers, because he had followed this evil spirit of his life.\n\nWith a loud cry he threw himself upon the lifeless form and wept, while the fair siren by his side laughed and laughed. Beside himself with indignation he panted, trying to strike her and hurl words of hatred in her face; but his hands fell helpless by his side; they had no power to execute his will. He seemed rooted to the ground.",
					
					"~<V.~>\n\n\"Get up from this wet ground, you fellow! How did you ever come here in this beastly weather?\" He heard a deep sympathetic voice by his side. Awakened from his swoon, soon he looked amazed around him. What had happened? He did not know at all. His limbs were helpless and he lay on the ground where he must have fallen. His treasured source of income, his precious book, containing all his humorous lectures, lay rain-soaked near his side. How long he had been lying there unconscious, he did not know himself. A slim well-dressed man stood before him, doing his best to help him get up and trying to comfort him as much as he could, shaking his head wonderingly, and inquiring how he ever happened to be lost in such a place.\n\nThe lecturer looked about him with great relief. He did not see the gnomes anywhere. So it was not true what they told him, what they sneered at-",
					
					"His heart rejoiced. It was only a hallucination, nothing else. All he had seen and heard must have been a stupid fancy of his tired brain. The best proof was, that he found himself lying helplessly on the ground, just awakening from a swoon.\n\nYes, the condition of his brain was at fault; that was as clear as daylight. \"Thank God!\" he exclaimed, while a feeling of unspeakable joy surged through his heart, now gladdened with thankfulness.\n\n\"I came near believing all that stupid nonsense of those wicked gnomes about my--\"\n\n\"Hey! listen to me, poor fellow! What in Heaven's name, are you doing here on that wet ground?\"\n\nIt was not until the stranger by his side had repeated his question that he could pull himself together and answer in a stammering voice, while a cold shiver shook his emaciated frame.\n\nHe looked at the stranger with dilated eyes. \"Beg pardon sir. I-I must have lost my way. I was to give a humorous lecture at a neighboring hotel, and-and fell down,\" he said helplessly,",
					
					"picking up his rain-soaked book, which he had discovered within reach.\n\n\"Why, you are wet through and through, my man. What can I do for you?\" asked the stranger with deep sympathy.\n\nA strange look of wonder illuminated the face of the downfallen man. He stammered: \"If you would have the great kindness to help bring me to the Mountain View Hotel. You see, I am expected there. I've got to earn some money tonight yet.\" He paused to cough; his voice seemed sepulchral.\n\n\"I have a motherless child to support.\" His head was bent to hide his emotion. \"My girlie must have all she needs. I-I couldn't stand it if they were to let her go hungry. God!\" Again a vehement cough shook his wasted frame.\n\n\"Well, well, this turns out all right. I'll bring you there as we are staying in the same hotel.\"\n\n\"He's got fever, sir-better let's get him on the box,\" he heard the coachman say who stood by his side looking with obvious pity at the man before him.\n\nA few paces away, a closed carriage was standing with two lighted lanterns in front of it.",
					
					"The storm had relented for a while, and mysterious silence fell upon the scene.\n\n\"Ogden!\" now called out an excited woman's voice from within the carriage. \"To miss the table d'hote on account of that wretched beggar. Why it's just unpardonable!\"\n\n\"That voice!... God have mercy!\"\n\nThe man on the ground stammered as if struck by lightning. His eyes dilated, starting out of their sockets and staring horrified at the carriage.\n\n\"That voice,\" he repeated. \"Could it be possible? Could she be there? Am I still under the influence of that horrible hallucination?\" he moaned piteously. He could not and would not believe a word of all they told him.\n\nAgain he seemed to hear the revolting chuckle of the insolent gnomes, from the Traunstein, repeating their malignant tales of the outrageous conduct of his-\n\n\"Up with you quickly, for we'll have more rain within a short time!\" said Mr. Ogden, now in a sympathetic voice, and at the same time heeding the woman's command in the carriage, which he",
					
					"would not have ignored for any consideration.\n\nThe coachman assisted the stranger to his seat on the box, and then Mr. Ogden entered the carriage, closing the door carefully.\n\nThen the splendid team of horses set off like the wind. \"God have pity on me! that voice!\"\n\nHe could never forget the voice of that alluring siren who had goaded him on, until he saw nothing but her seductive face, listened to nothing but her deceitful declarations of love, without thinking of his mother's grief and her death!\n\nCould it be possible? She here in that closed carriage with another man? No, no! It was another hallucination of his feverish brain.\n\nHow could she ever have attained such wealth? \"Nonsense!\" he murmured smilingly to himself, drawing a long breath of relief. Ah! how he had adored that faithless woman!\n\nThe smiling expression died out of his face, and a mournful compassion for his deserted child stole into his troubled countenance. Why did she bring so much misery into his life? Every fibre of his noble heart had been throbbing with uncontrollable love for her! And now--the light of life, the hope of",
					
					"future years, was blotted out, clouds of despair and a grim night of an unbroken desolation fell like a pall on his heart and brain. Nothing to look forward to but misery!",
					
					"~<VI.~>\n\nHe had wandered about like a soul condemned and lost to eternity. But the one hope to meet her again possessed him, kept him alive. And then-she'll come back to him-he was convinced of that; to his lonely little Mary. And after all she might be touched by his devoted love that knows how to pardon and overlook certain occurrences in the life of a giddy-headed woman!\n\nUnfortunately the cold, calculating coquette had never felt a tinge of anything like love, and had only an observing eye for the monthly allowances he received from his well-to-do parents.\n\nHe had come to Dresden a young, inexperienced student to pursue a course in literature and jurisprudence. The handsome, dashing woman, somewhere in the twenties, soon allured him with her well tried arts. Within a short time he was her devoted slave and did not see nor hear anything else but her alluring voice, and after six months' acquaintance he led her to the altar",
					
					"without the knowledge of his parents.\n\nWhen they found it out, through a friend living in Dresden, they were in despair, in their helpless anger. His mother never recovered from the rude shock her ambition had received. She did not know the woman, but when she heard that she belonged to a different faith, she was crushed, although the noble catholicity of spirit that distinguished her character did not allow her to show it. Her proudest hope to see that beloved son some day a respected citizen and lawyer in that little provincial town where his cradle stood, was gone forever!\n\nYears of wrestling with life's sorrows had set upon her noble, benignant countenance, almost a seal of holiness, and shed over her placid features the mild, sweet life of a pure heart. Her white hair, the snowy mass prematurely white, wonderfully softened the outlines of her face.\n\nNow deep lines commenced to furrow her sweet, indulgent features, and she grieved so deeply over the disgrace that she began to lose her health. Silently, without a word to her husband she performed her household duties, until one day",
					
					"her enfeebled constitution gave way and she died, praying for the only child she had ever had.\n\nHer husband, Mr. Burge, under the double stress of the sorrow, refused to hear anything of the ungrateful son, for whom he had slaved and worked all his life, and whose grievous mistake in marrying an adventuress, had cost the mother's life.\n\nHe had a large estate to look after, but he was alone now. He needed the son, but what could he do? He was ashamed of the daughter-in-law! \"No, not a cent of my money can she have,\" he murmured constantly to himself with a flushed face and dry lips, looking at his imposing estate, where the beautiful Rhine rushed by and the tumbled down castles of long-forgotten races were seen in the distance.\n\nThe irate father dissolved all connection with the son and stopped all payments, denying him any assistance whatsoever in the future.\n\nAfter the regular allowance from home had entirely ceased, it was necessary for the young husband to go and seek some profitable employment",
					
					"to support his expensive wife.\n\nHe had never earned a cent, and racked his brain now how to get money. The tantalizing condition pressed upon him that he might not be able to support his family. Finally, he got a position with a meagre salary in a newspaper office, but he was scarcely able to provide the barest necessaries of life.\n\nHe commenced to write short stories. Although he had no ambition to climb to such a lofty niche in the temple of fame, he thought he might at least earn a modest income. Short stories and humorous lectures-that must make a hit. Everybody said that he had a humorous vein. Now the time had come to show his mettle, but the short stories were generally returned. The irate father had ceased to send money and no other help was discoverable. And then-after all that-she, his loving wife, dropped her mask and showed herself in her true colors.\n\n\"I have had enough of this,\" she said with a disgusted shrug of her white shoulders to her horrified husband. \"I don't intend to starve",
					
					"here.\"\n\nIn vain he begged her to have a little patience for the sake of their child. The last short story must turn out to be a great success; he felt it and was really convinced of it.\n\n\"Convinced,\" she sneered contemptuously and turned away. No use of losing any breath about it, she thought. I am through with him anyway. Oh! How she longed to be rich, wear stylish clothes and be admired.\n\nThe beautiful coquette became restless in her little home; she looked about sick at heart, unable to tolerate it any longer, only wishing to get the opportunity to leave it forever. Her eyes were full of scorn when looking at her husband, who could not supply her with all that she longed for just now, and for which she would have pledged the salvation of her very soul. She commenced to frequent public places in the absence of her husband.\n\nHow she loathed poverty! \"Anything but that,\" she murmured to herself, her face white with disgust as she walked on, gazing in all directions to see one of her former acquaintances,",
					
					"with a strange unrest in her large eyes. Her opportunity would come; she was sure of that, and it came in meeting one day the rich Englishman who was introduced to her by one of her former friends and boon companions.\n\nShortly after this encounter, she received a letter from the Englishman telling her of the deep and lasting impression she had made on him and how he longed to see her again. Her face flushed with pleasure as she read all these, and then perused an invitation to take an automobile ride through the beautiful mountains.\n\nFor some time she sat dazzled, and then she looked at the poorly furnished rooms; at her own wretched outfit, and her eyes flashed indignantly.\n\n\"I am through with all this. Here is the opportunity I was longing for,\" she said with a contemptuous smile. \"I'll show him-the young inexperienced fool I have married-that beauty counts for a whole lot and ... boldness even more.\"\n\nShe stopped at the window and looked down at the Englishman's automobile before her door.",
					
					"\"The opportunity-my opportunity has come.\" These words rang ceaselessly in her ears and filled her being with a strange endeavor to avenge herself on the man who could not supply her with all the luxuries she craved for, and according to her ethics, was entitled to.",
					
					"~<VII.~>\n\nIt was on Christmas eve, her husband had come home with a radiant face. His short story had been accepted, and the money was in his pocket. Now he could buy a fitting present for his wife. Of course it could not be too expensive, but she certainly would enjoy it all the same; he was sure of that, feeling that the opening of a successful career was inaugurated.\n\nOn his way home he had also bought a little fir tree to set up for the first Christmas celebration in his own home. The recollections of similar holidays in the house of his parents stirred him to the depths. How his heart quivered when he thought of his dear mother he loved so dearly. If she only were alive how different everything would be! He, who was brought up in luxury, mother's pet, and now-\n\nWith deep emotion he entered the house. With a brisk step he opened the door, looked around and found it empty, the wife and all her belongings gone!",
					
					"The horror of that night was something he could never forget as long as he lived. Holding his ten months' old child in his trembling arms, he wept burning tears for her, the mother of his child. Could it be possible? A mother deserting her child on this holiest of evenings? He could not believe his eyes, but all she possessed went with her. No, no, she was giddy-headed, but not cruel. Motherhood must assert itself and surely would. How he loved her, how he longed to take her in his arms and feed his poor, famished heart with a touch of her lips!\n\nHe sat there in the dark listening and waiting for her to come back, to see the presents he had bought for her, and the money he wanted to give her. But one hour after another passed and nobody came. In the streets a joyous throng of merry makers pushed and jostled about wishing each other a merry Christmas. His heart was shaken to its depths by maddening grief; by bitter disappointment.\n\nThe room was icy cold, there was no fire in the stove, and the child half starved, screamed weakly in his arms. In wild desperation he trampled on the little Christmas tree he had",
					
					"brought along to celebrate his first Christmas in his own home! He could see nothing but falsehood and treachery in this world. What meaning was there for him in this life-redeeming symbol?\n\nSick of everything he longed for death to come and take him and his little child away. Throughout that dreary night of agony he lay in bed holding the child in his arms, pressing his lips against her tender little hands, without being able to close an eye.\n\nThe bell in the neighboring churches rang out in the ears of the deserted man, sounding dismally through his lonely house. But they brought back pictures to his mind of his childhood's happy days, when he went to church on similar Christmas eves with his parents. One tear after another stole into his desperate eyes.\n\n\"God have mercy on me and my child,\" he murmured stammeringly. \"I must, I will live for her sake. I cannot leave her altogether an orphan,\" though the gaping wound in his own heart kept on bleeding, bleeding incessantly.",
					
					"~<VIII.~>\n\n\"There! Here we are at last, no weather for a dog to be out,\" growled the angry coachman sulkily, jumping down from the box and opening the carriage door with a respectful bow, hat in hand.\n\nMr. Ogden staggered quickly out and lifted tenderly and carefully a woman's form to the wet ground. Young Burge, the deserted husband, had just come down with the help of the coachman who growled something he could not understand.\n\nHe looked at the woman in the darkness and a mist swam before his eyes; he leaned against the coach and his knees shook so that he could not make a single step. The night was black and the wind sobbed down the street, while the rain still fell in torrents.\n\nHe could not see clearly-but that voice-that voice! God! \"Could they have been right-these wicked, malicious gnomes? Did they know all about her and now, how?\" he asked himself while his hands clutched the book convulsively in his",
					
					"helpless agony.\n\nHe thought he heard them again whispering, with a derisive chuckle, the whole story of her downfall into his terrified ears.\n\n\"How could she ever come to such magnificent clothes?\" he thought. \"Nonsense! It is simply a hallucination of a morbid, disordered brain. I am sick and miserable and see things where there is nothing to see.\" This he murmured half aloud to himself, gazing at the retreating form of the woman incredulously. He could not distinguish her features and he made up his mind forcibly, in order to quiet down his excited nerves, that it was nothing else but a foolish trick of his imagination, and the fever which shook him now again was the obvious cause of it all. \"Anyway, how could she have obtained all this luxurious outfit? His wife wealthy? Nonsense!\"\n\nHe tried to laugh cheerfully about this foolishness, but suddenly he felt as though a knife were plunged into his heart. \"The gnomes! the gnomes! If that which they had said were true!\" He moaned to himself, leaning against the wall",
					
					"in a faint condition. \"Oh, anything but that ... anything but that!\" His whole frame shook as from palsy. That voice haunted him. He knew he had to go and look at her in order to convince himself, otherwise he could not find any rest.",
					
					"~<IX.~>\n\n\"Come, come! You must not lose your courage, my good fellow,\" said Mr. Ogden good-naturedly, coming out of the house at the same time. \"But before you do anything else, you should go inside and get those wet clothes off; yes, that you must do, my man, you look pale enough indeed, and....\"\n\n\"The deuce! If that is not our expected entertainer, the humorous lecturer from Ishle!\" cried the stout, dignified hotelier, with a laugh as he caught sight of the dripping form of the poor, dazed lecturer.\n\n\"Lord, what a state he is in! Why he isn't able to lecture!\"\n\n\"Never mind, a hot grog, some dry clothes from my wardrobe, and the rest will soon be managed,\" said Mr. Ogden good-naturedly with a sign to his valet, greatly gratified in being able to help the poor, miserable looking man with the pallor of death on his emaciated face.",
					
					"\"And as for your entertainment being a great success, well-leave that to me, my dear fellow and don't worry; it will be all right,\" he went on, clapping the dazed humorist on the shoulder with an encouraging smile.\n\nHe bowed, without being able to utter a word of thanks; he bit his trembling lips and followed the valet with stumbling, shivering feet.\n\n\"Who could this benevolent stranger be? And what was he to that woman? Was he mistaken or not? If, after all she should be his-his-\"\n\nA hot wave flushed his face, distorted with shame as he thought of the possibility; his sorely tried heart was hammering mightily within him.\n\nHe could not get rid of this thought. \"If she should really be the mother of his poor child ... what, in the name of Heaven, was she then to this man? God have mercy on me and come to my aid!\" he cried aloud, in great misery, his teeth once more chattering audibly in a fresh attack. \"No, no! I can't and won't believe it! She can't be so shameless as to disgrace me and her innocent child!\"",
					
					"\"Come, come quickly, sir,\" urged the valet impatiently, \"I'll help you as much as I can.\"\n\nAfter he had provided him with all the necessary clothes from the elaborately assorted wardrobe of the rich Englishman, who was about the same size, he made as careful a toilet as possible, under the prevailing circumstances and under the careful inspection of the helpful valet.",
					
					"~<X.~>\n\nThe supper bell now rang through the vast corridors of the Mountain View Hotel, crowded with tourists from all parts of the continent. Ladies, gorgeously dressed, commenced to take their seats at the supper tables in the dining room, escorted by elegantly garbed gentlemen; some of them in full evening dress, others again in black cutaway. The clatter of knives and forks had already begun. The spacious dining room was brightly illuminated. At the further end a carpet-covered platform was visible, whose edges were a bank of flowers. Everything was tastefully arranged. A pianist was already hammering away at a waltz of one of the latest operatic successes, with frightful execution, as an introduction to the interesting program of the evening, anxiously awaited by the patrons of the house.\n\nThe clatter, the bustling noise, had suddenly stopped and all eyes were riveted expectantly on the man who had just entered. Our humorist, suffering in mind and body alike, pale and",

					"haggard, with restless eyes, made his appearance in the borrowed clothes which hung loosely about his emaciated form, tossing back his long locks with his right hand, while holding the cherished book tightly in the other, he came down to the very edge of the platform and smiled and bowed in all directions.\n\nHe looked exhausted and weary, as he was. But the room was crowded and he had to go on, whether he wanted or not, so he commenced: \"Ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\nHe got no further. A mist swam suddenly before his eyes. A shiver shook his emaciated frame, his face became flushed and bloated and he stared and stared.\n\nA side door had been opened a few minutes before and Mr. Ogden entered with the much admired Cleopatra on his arm.\n\nThey passed through the crowded dining room, close to the speaker's platform. She had changed her dazzling costume for a simpler, but an extremely stylish dress of blue silk. She still wore some of the lilies in the marvelous golden hair, which was now fastened with a gold comb into a",

					"plain Greek knot. She was all aglow with excitement. The triumph of the afternoon was still lingering on her handsome face. She felt like shouting it out to everybody. Such conquest does not come often to a woman in the ordinary walks of life.\n\nShe walked proudly, with a queenly step to her seat, nodding to some casual acquaintances with a charming smile. And then she took her seat and turned a glance of curiosity upon the famished face of the entertainer. Their eyes met-and for a few seconds sank into each others' like sharp daggers. A red tinge covered her startled face, then she turned away, whiter than the lilies on her breast. She trembled visibly and looked frightened, casting down her eyes.\n\nMr. Ogden did not seem to have noticed any change in her appearance and gazed with a shocked countenance and great pity at the reduced exterior of the poor humorist. Suddenly a great excitement was noticeable among all the guests sitting around the small tables. Several gentlemen had left their seats, rushed towards the place where the poor entertainer had collapsed after",

					"recognizing his faithless wife garbed in that splendor, so shamefully acquired, of which the wicked gnomes were whispering so constantly into his ears.\n\nHe still believed in her then; but now-the dark, threatening expression in his livid face was frightful to behold. He murmured something about the gnomes that nobody could understand, staring with hatred in his dilated eyes in the direction where she sat-she, the mother of his innocent child, now disgraced forever!\n\n\"God! What have I done to deserve such a punishment?\" he murmured once more, pressing his bloodless lips tightly together as a cold perspiration broke out on his deathlike face.\n\nA vision of his mother's warning and sorrows was presented to his benighted intelligence and made him cry with terror and shame. The conflicting emotions were too much for the sadly undermined constitution.\n\n\"The wicked gnomes!\" he whispered with audible scorn and contempt in his blazing eyes, as if sudden madness had seized on him, and then tried to curse her, but not another word escaped",

					"his tightly closed lips, though the blood began to gush from them.\n\nThe truth, so cruelly thrust upon him, ended his life's drama; his eyes closed, he fell in a heap to the floor.\n\nThe pitying guests stood helplessly around him and did not know what to do. Mr. Ogden was the first one who had presence of mind to send to the nearest village in search of a doctor.\n\nThe beautiful Cleopatra sat there as pale as a ghost and was afraid to go near the prostrate form of her unhappy husband, fearing that someone might lift the veil and show the audience the ugliness of her real self. A feeling of restlessness rushed upon her as if the shameful story were being written on her flushed face. She could not endure it any longer and left the dining room.\n\nMr. Ogden did not notice her departure, and busied himself around the dying man, asking what he could do for him. The poor man pointed to a letter in his side pocket where the addresses of his friends in Dresden were written down.",

					"\"The gnomes! ... the gnomes!\" he stammered once more as the shadow of death began to close in upon him. The blood streamed out incessantly, and before the aid of a doctor could be secured, he was a corpse.",

					"~<XI.~>\n\nMr. Ogden, deeply moved, went to his rooms.\n\nShe, the cause of it all, sat at the window with a book in her hands without reading it. There was a look in the woman's face that amazed him, a hard, cold look, that he had never seen there before while the sunbeams fell on her bewitching features and on the green leaves still in her hair.\n\n\"I want to leave the place at once,\" she said without looking at him.\n\n\"That poor man's face seems to haunt you, dear tender-hearted girlie,\" he replied with an outburst of tenderness, taking her in his arms and kissing the handsome face he loved so dearly.\n\nIt was a fortunate thing that he was blissfully ignorant of her relation to the dead man.\n\nGathering up courage-seeing that no suspicion had entered his mind-she raised her beautiful eyes to his languidly.\n\n\"Yes, you are right, dear, I cannot stand such horrible things ... it shocks me,\" she answered with her accustomed dissimulation in tone and",

					"action.\n\nAlthough she was a great adept in the art of hypocrisy and dissimulation, she could not altogether hide the uneasiness which had taken possession of her. A strange expression came into her eyes, an expression he had never seen there. He looked at her and was puzzled. What was it? What brought the change about? He could not tell.\n\nShe turned suddenly and looked out of the window with a stony face, in order to hide, to subdue,-what? Did she conjure up a sinful vision of her own life? No, she would not give in, but she was startled to perceive something within her she did not reckon with: a voice wanted to be heard, no matter how hard she tried to subdue it. It was the voice of motherhood-that feeling seemed to be not quite dead in the heart of the shameless woman. It was Nature's revenge! She had to listen to the voice of Nature, or was it conscience, slowly awakening to life?\n\nAh! Who would or could fathom the heart of an unscrupulous coquette?",

					"\"Had he any family?\" she asked, indifferently, avoiding his inquisitive gaze.\n\n\"Yes, I think he has a child, here is the address,\" he replied. \"I think it must be with someone he knew, poor unfortunate man. And he gave me this in order to look up his orphan child.\" A mournful compassion soon stole into his eyes.\n\n\"He could not speak any more, but the pitiful glance of the dying man's face told me as much, and I am going to Dresden and see whether I can do anything for his child,\" he added, looking deeply moved out of the window. She gazed at him with puzzled eyes. \"God! if he had an inkling whose child that is!\" she thought, remorsefully recoiling a step with downcast eyes and tightened lips.\n\nFinally summoning up courage enough, she said, hesitatingly, as if fearing any comment:\n\n\"Yes, ... let us stop there on our way to Switzerland.\"\n\nHe wanted to stay until the funeral of the poor lecturer was over, but she would not hear of it. She looked at him with frightened eyes when he made the suggestion.",

					"\"I cannot stand such scenes,\" she replied with quivering lips.\n\n\"Well, well! Then we'll go, my sensitive little girlie. That accident seemed to have upset your nervous system,\" he said with a smile, kissing her tenderly and gazing fondly at her troubled face.\n\nOn the following morning they took their departure for Dresden, leaving some money for the funeral expenses in the hands of the hotel keeper.\n\nInstinctively he felt like doing something for the man he had robbed of his happiness without knowing it.\n\nBut the unscrupulous coquette loved nobody but herself, knew it, felt it, though without any remorse, that she had betrayed his deep devotion and undying love so shamefully, fearing, in her deceitfulness, only one thing-detection.\n\nThe following day a simple hearse, containing the corpse of the poor humorist whose life ended so tragically, went up a lonely hill where the grave diggers had just finished their gloomy work. The coffin was lowered and the grave covered with mother earth. No mourners stood around shedding tears.",

					"The song of a mocking-bird rang from the downy cradle of myrtle blossoms-as a funeral dirge-and a whip-poor-will answered from a cedar in the neighboring woods.\n\nWhen the night train going to Dresden, rushed by, the little white cross indicating his resting place, looked like a bleached hand of a skeleton shining out with a ghostly radiance across the silent, gloomy plain.\n\nThrough the fleecy vapors floating around the lonely hill one with clairvoyant eye may see at midnights the vacillating horde of the tiny gnomes from the Traunstein with downcast torches repeating whisperingly the sad tale, and pointing at the grave, in which the body of the dead humorist, betrayed of his life's happiness, crumbles to dust."

					"There is scarcely any literary work of great importance which has been less readily available for the general reader, or even for the serious student of literature, than the Poetic Edda. Translations have been far from numerous, and only in Germany has the complete work of translation been done in the full light of recent scholarship. In English the only versions were long the conspicuously inadequate one made by Thorpe, and published about half a century ago, and the unsatisfactory prose translations in Vigfusson and Powell's ~<Corpus Poeticum Boreale~>, reprinted in the Norroena collection. An excellent translation of the poems dealing with the gods, in verse and with critical and explanatory notes, made by Olive Bray, was, however, published by the Viking Club of London in 1908. In French there exist only partial translations, chief among them being those made by Bergmann many years ago. Among the seven or eight German versions, those by the Brothers Grimm and by Karl Simrock, which had considerable historical importance because of their influence on nineteenth century German literature and art, and particularly on the work of Richard Wagner, have been largely superseded by Hugo Gering's admirable translation, published in 1892, and by the recent two volume rendering by Genzmer, with excellent notes by Andreas Heusler, 194-1920. There are competent translations in both Norwegian and Swedish. The lack of any complete and adequately annotated English rendering in metrical form, based on a critical text, and profiting by the cumulative labors of such scholars as Mogk, Vigfusson,",
					
					"Finnur Jonsson, Grundtvig, Bugge, Gislason, Hildebrand, LÃ¼ning, Sweet, Niedner, EttmÃ¼ller, MÃ¼llenhoff, Edzardi, B. M. Olsen, Sievers, Sijmons, Detter, Heinzel, Falk, Neckel, Heusler, and Gering, has kept this extraordinary work practically out of the reach of those who have had neither time nor inclination to master the intricacies of the original Old Norse. \n\nOn the importance of the material contained in the ~<Poetic Edda~> it is here needless to dwell at any length. We have inherited the Germanic traditions in our very speech, and the ~<Poetic Edda~> is the original storehouse of Germanic mythology. It is, indeed, in many ways the greatest literary monument preserved to us out of the antiquity of the kindred races which we call Germanic. Moreover, it has a literary value altogether apart from its historical significance. The mythological poems include, in the ~<Voluspo~>, one of the vastest conceptions of the creation and ultimate destruction of the world ever crystallized in literary form; in parts of the ~<Hovamol~>, a collection of wise counsels that can bear comparison with most of the Biblical Book of Proverbs; in the ~<Lokasenna~>, a comedy none the less full of vivid characterization because its humor is often broad; and in the ~<Thrymskvitha~>, one of the finest ballads in the world. The hero poems give us, in its oldest and most vivid extant form, the story of Sigurth, Brynhild, and Atli, the Norse parallel to the German ~<Nibelungenlied~>. The Poetic Edda is not only of great interest to the student of antiquity; it is a collection including some of the most remark able poems which have been preserved to us from the period before the pen and the printing-press. replaced the poet-singer and oral tradition. It is above all else the desire",
					
					"to make better known the dramatic force, the vivid and often tremendous imagery, and the superb conceptions embodied in these poems which has called forth the present translation. \n\n~<What is the Poetic Edda?~>\n\nEven if the poems of the so-called Edda were not so significant and intrinsically so valuable, the long series of scholarly struggles which have been going on over them for the better part of three centuries would in itself give them a peculiar interest. Their history is strangely mysterious. We do not know who composed them, or when or where they were composed; we are by no means sure who collected them or when he did so; finally, we are not absolutely certain as to what an \"Edda\" is, and the best guess at the meaning of the word renders its application to this collection of poems more or less misleading. \n\nA brief review of the chief facts in the history of the ~<Poetic Edda~> will explain why this uncertainty has persisted. Preserved in various manuscripts of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries is a prose work consisting of a very extensive collection of mythological stories, an explanation of the important figures and tropes of Norse poetic diction,--the poetry of the Icelandic and Norwegian skalds was appallingly complex in this respect,--and a treatise on metrics. This work, clearly a handbook for poets, was commonly known as the \"Edda\" of Snorri Sturluson, for at the head of the copy of it in the ~<Uppsalabok~>, a manuscript written presumably some fifty or sixty years after Snorri's death, which was in 1241, we find: \"This book is called Edda, which Snorri Sturluson composed.\" This work, well known as the ~<Prose Edda~>, Snorri's ~<Edda~> or the",
					
					"~<Younger Edda~>, has recently been made available to readers of English in the admirable translation by Arthur G. Brodeur, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1916.\n\nIcelandic tradition, however, persisted in ascribing either this ~<Edda~> or one resembling it to Snorri's much earlier compatriot, SÃ¦mund the Wise (1056-1133). When, early in the seventeenth century, the learned Arngrimur Jonsson proved to everyone's satisfaction that Snorri and nobody else must have been responsible for the work in question, the next thing to determine was what, if anything, SÃ¦mund had done of the same kind. The nature of Snorri's book gave a clue. In the mythological stories related a number of poems were quoted, and as these and other poems were to all appearances Snorri's chief sources of information, it was assumed that SÃ¦mund must have written or compiled a verse ~<Edda~>--whatever an \"Edda\" might be--on which Snorri's work was largely based.\n\nSo matters stood when, in 1643, Brynjolfur Sveinsson, Bishop of Skalholt, discovered a manuscript, clearly written as early as 1300, containing twenty-nine poems, complete or fragmentary, and some of them with the very lines and stanzas used by Snorri. Great was the joy of the scholars, for here, of course, must be at least a part of the long-sought ~<Edda~> of SÃ¦mund the Wise. Thus the good bishop promptly labeled his find, and as SÃ¦mund's ~<Edda~>, the ~<Elder Edda~> or the ~<Poetic Edda~> it has been known to this day.\n\nThis precious manuscript, now in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and known as the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> (R2365), has been the basis for all published editions of the Eddic poems. A few poems of similar character found elsewhere",
					
					"have subsequently been added to the collection, until now most editions include, as in this translation, a total of thirty-four. A shorter manuscript now in the ArnamagnÃ¦an collection in Copenhagen (AM748), contains fragmentary or complete versions of six of the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~>, and one other, ~<Baldrs Draumar~>, not found in that collection. Four other poems (~<Rigsthula~>, ~<Hyndluljoth~>, ~<Grougaldr~> and ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~>, the last two here combined under the title of Svipdagsmol), from various manuscripts, so closely resemble in subject-matter and style the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~> that they have been included by most editors in the collection. Finally, Snorri's ~<Edda~> contains one complete poem, the ~<Grottasongr~>, which many editors have added to the poetic collection; it is, however, not included in this translation, as an admirable English version of it is available in Mr. Brodeur's rendering of Snorri's work.\n\nFrom all this it is evident that the ~<Poetic Edda~>, as we now know it, is no definite and plainly limited work, but rather a more or less haphazard collection of separate poems, dealing either with Norse mythology or with hero-cycles unrelated to the traditional history of greater Scandinavia or Iceland. How many other similar poems, now lost, may have existed in such collections as were current in Iceland in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries we cannot know, though it is evident that some poems of this type are missing. We can say only that thirty-four poems have been preserved, twenty-nine of them in a single manuscript collection, which differ considerably in subject-matter and style from all the rest of extant Old Norse poetry, and these we group together as the ~<Poetic Edda~>.",
					
					"But what does the word \"Edda\" mean? Various guesses have been made. An early assumption was that the word somehow meant \"Poetics,\" which fitted Snorri's treatise to a nicety, but which, in addition to the lack of philological evidence to support this interpretation, could by no stretch of scholarly subtlety be made appropriate to the collection of poems. Jacob Grimm ingeniously identified the word with the word \"edda\" used in one of the poems, the ~<Rigsthula~>, where, rather conjecturally, it means \"great-grand mother.\" The word exists in this sense no where else in Norse literature, and Grimm's suggestion of \"Tales of a Grandmother,\" though at one time it found wide acceptance, was grotesquely inappropriate to either the prose or the verse work.\n\nAt last Eirikr Magnusson hit on what appears the likeliest solution of the puzzle: that \"Edda\" is simply the genitive form of the proper name \"Oddi.\" Oddi was a settlement in the southwest of Iceland, certainly the home of Snorri Sturluson for many years, and, traditionally at least, also the home of SÃ¦mund the Wise. That Snorri's work should have been called \"The Book of Oddi\" is altogether reasonable, for such a method of naming books was common--witness the \"Book of the Flat Island\" and other early manuscripts. That SÃ¦mund may also have written or compiled another \"Oddi-Book\" is perfectly possible, and that tradition should have said he did so is entirely natural.\n\nIt is, however, an open question whether or not SÃ¦mund had anything to do with making the collection, or any part of it, now known as the Poetic Edda, for of course the seventeenth-century assignment of the work to him is negligible.",
					
					"We can say only that he may have made some such compilation, for he was a diligent student of Icelandic tradition and history, and was famed throughout the North for his learning. But otherwise no trace of his works survives, and as he was educated in Paris, it is probable that he wrote rather in Latin than in the vernacular.\n\nAll that is reasonably certain is that by the middle or last of the twelfth century there existed in Iceland one or more written collections of Old Norse mythological and heroic poems, that the ~<Codex Regius~>, a copy made a hundred years or so later, represents at least a considerable part of one of these, and that the collection of thirty-four poems which we now know as the ~<Poetic~> or ~<Elder Edda~> is practically all that has come down to us of Old Norse poetry of this type. Anything more is largely guesswork, and both the name of the compiler and the meaning of the title \"Edda\" are conjectural.\n\n~<The Origin of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThere is even less agreement about the birthplace, authorship and date of the Eddic poems themselves than about the nature of the existing collection. Clearly the poems were the work of many different men, living in different periods; clearly, too, most of them existed in oral tradition for generations before they were committed to writing. In general, the mythological poems seem strongly marked by pagan sincerity, although efforts have been made to prove them the results of deliberate archaizing; and as Christianity became generally accepted throughout the Norse world early in the eleventh century, it seems altogether likely that most of the poems dealing",
					
					"with the gods definitely antedate the year 1000. The earlier terminus is still a matter of dispute. The general weight of critical opinion, based chiefly on the linguistic evidence presented by Hoffory, Finnur Jonsson and others, has indicated that the poems did not assume anything closely analogous to their present forms prior to the ninth century. On the other hand, Magnus Olsen's interpretation of the inscriptions on the Eggjum Stone, which he places as early as the seventh century, have led so competent a scholar as Birger Nerman to say that \"we may be warranted in concluding that some of the Eddic poems may have originated, wholly or partially, in the second part of the seventh century.\" As for the poems belonging to the hero cycles, one or two of them appear to be as late as 1100, but most of them probably date back at least to the century and a half following 900. It is a reasonable guess that the years between 850 and 1050 saw the majority of the Eddic poems worked into definite shape, but it must be remembered that many changes took place during the long subsequent period of oral transmission, and also that many of the legends, both mythological and heroic, on which the poems were based certainly existed in the Norse regions, and quite possibly in verse form, long before the year 900.\n\nAs to the origin of the legends on which the poems are based, the whole question, at least so far as the stories of the gods are concerned, is much too complex for discussion here. How much of the actual narrative material of the mythological lays is properly to be called Scandinavian is a matter for students of comparative mythology to",
					
					"guess at. The tales underlying the heroic lays are clearly of foreign origin: the Helgi story comes from Denmark, and that of VÃ¶lund from Germany, as also the great mass of traditions centering around Sigurth (Siegfried), Brynhild, the sons of Gjuki, Atli (Attila), and Jormunrek (Ermanarich). The introductory notes to the various poems deal with the more important of these questions of origin. of the men who composed these poems,--\"wrote\" is obviously the wrong word--we know absolutely nothing, save that some of them must have been literary artists with a high degree of conscious skill. The Eddic poems are \"folk-poetry,\"--whatever that may be,--only in the sense that some of them strongly reflect racial feelings and beliefs; they are anything but crude or primitive in workmanship, and they show that not only the poets themselves, but also many of their hearers, must have made a careful study of the art of poetry.\n\nWhere the poems were shaped is equally uncertain. Any date prior to 875 would normally imply an origin on the mainland, but the necessarily fluid state of oral tradition made it possible for a poem to be \"composed\" many times over, and in various and far-separated places, without altogether losing its identity. Thus, even if a poem first assumed something approximating its present form in Iceland in the tenth century, it may none the less embody language characteristic of Norway two centuries earlier. Oral poetry has always had an amazing preservative power over language, and in considering the origins of such poems as these, we must cease thinking in terms of the printing-press, or even in those of the scribe. The",
					
					"claims of Norway as the birthplace of most of the Eddic poems have been extensively advanced, but the great literary activity of Iceland after the settlement of the island by Norwegian emigrants late in the ninth century makes the theory of an Icelandic home for many of the poems appear plausible. The two Atli lays, with what authority we do not know, bear in the ~<Codex Regius~> the superscription \"the Greenland poem,\" and internal evidence suggests that this statement may be correct. Certainly in one poem, the ~<Rigsthula~>, and probably in several others, there are marks of Celtic influence. During a considerable part of the ninth and tenth centuries, Scandinavians were active in Ireland and in most of the western islands inhabited by branches of the Celtic race. Some scholars have, indeed, claimed nearly all the Eddic poems for these \"Western Isles.\" However, as Iceland early came to be the true cultural center of this Scandinavian island world, it may be said that the preponderant evidence concerning the development of the Eddic poems in anything like their present form points in that direction, and certainly it was in Iceland that they were chiefly preserved.\n\n~<The Edda and Old Norse Literature~>\n\nWithin the proper limits of an introduction it would be impossible to give any adequate summary of the history and literature with which the Eddic poems are indissolubly connected, but a mere mention of a few of the salient facts may be of some service to those who are unfamiliar with the subject. Old Norse literature covers approximately the period between 850 and 1300. During the first part of",
					
					"that period occurred the great wanderings of the Scandinavian peoples, and particularly the Norwegians. A convenient date to remember is that of the sea-fight of Hafrsfjord, 872, when Harald the Fair-Haired broke the power of the independent Norwegian nobles, and made himself overlord of nearly all the country. Many of the defeated nobles fled overseas, where inviting refuges had been found for them by earlier wanderers and plunder-seeking raiders. This was the time of the inroads of the dreaded Northmen in France, and in 885 Hrolf Gangr (Rollo) laid siege to Paris itself. Many Norwegians went to Ireland, where their compatriots had already built Dublin, and where they remained in control of most of the island till Brian Boru shattered their power at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.\n\nOf all the migrations, however, the most important were those to Iceland. Here grew up an active civilization, fostered by absolute independence and by remoteness from the wars which wracked Norway, yet kept from degenerating into provincialism by the roving life of the people, which brought them constantly in contact with the culture of the South. Christianity, introduced throughout the Norse world about the year 1000, brought with it the stability of learning, and the Icelanders became not only the makers but also the students and recorders of history. The years between 875 and 1100 were the great spontaneous period of oral literature. Most of the military and political leaders were also poets, and they composed a mass of lyric poetry concerning the authorship of which we know a good deal, and much of which has been preserved. Narrative",
					
					"prose also flourished, for the Icelander had a passion for story-telling and story-hearing. After 1100 came the day of the writers. These sagamen collected the material that for generations had passed from mouth to mouth, and gave it permanent form in writing. The greatest bulk of what we now have of Old Norse literature,--and the published part of it makes a formidable library,--originated thus in the earlier period before the introduction of writing, and was put into final shape by the scholars, most of them Icelanders, of the hundred years following 1150.\n\nAfter 1250 came a rapid and tragic decline. Iceland lost its independence, becoming a Norwegian province. Later Norway too fell under alien rule, a Swede ascending the Norwegian throne in 1320. Pestilence and famine laid waste the whole North; volcanic disturbances worked havoc in Iceland. Literature did not quite die, but it fell upon evil days; for the vigorous native narratives and heroic poems of the older period were substituted translations of French romances. The poets wrote mostly doggerel; the prose writers were devoid of national or racial inspiration.\n\nThe mass of literature thus collected and written down largely between 1150 and 1250 maybe roughly divided into four groups. The greatest in volume is made up of the sagas: narratives mainly in prose, ranging all the way from authentic history of the Norwegian kings and the early Icelandic settlements to fairy-tales. Embodied in the sagas is found the material composing the second group: the skaldic poetry, a vast collection of songs of praise, triumph, love, lamentation, and so on, almost uniformly characterized",
					
					"by an appalling complexity of figurative language. There is no absolute line to be drawn between the poetry of the skalds and the poems of the ~<Edda~>, which we may call the third group; but in addition to the remarkable artificiality of style which marks the skaldic poetry, and which is seldom found in the poems of the ~<Edda~>, the skalds dealt almost exclusively with their own emotions, whereas the Eddic poems are quite impersonal. Finally, there is the fourth group, made up of didactic works, religious and legal treatises, and so on, studies which originated chiefly in the later period of learned activity.\n\n~<Preservation of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nMost of the poems of the ~<Poetic Edda~> have unquestionably reached us in rather bad shape. During the long period of oral transmission they suffered all sorts of interpolations, omissions and changes, and some of them, as they now stand, are a bewildering hodge-podge of little related fragments. To some extent the diligent twelfth century compiler to whom we owe the ~<Codex Regius~>--SÃ¦mund or another--was himself doubtless responsible for the patchwork process, often supplemented by narrative prose notes of his own; but in the days before written records existed, it was easy to lose stanzas and longer passages from their context, and equally easy to interpolate them where they did not by any means belong. Some few of the poems, however, appear to be virtually complete and unified as we now have them.\n\nUnder such circumstances it is clear that the establishment of a satisfactory text is a matter of the utmost difficulty. As the basis for this translation I have used the text",
					
					"prepared by Karl Hildebrand (1876) and revised by Hugo Gering (1904). Textual emendation has, however, been so extensive in every edition of the ~<Edda~>, and has depended so much on the theories of the editor, that I have also made extensive use of many other editions, notably those by Finnur Jonsson, Neckel, Sijmons, and Detter and Heinzel, together with numerous commentaries. The condition of the text in both the principal codices is such that no great reliance can be placed on the accuracy of the copyists, and frequently two editions will differ fundamentally as to their readings of a given passage or even of an entire-poem. For this reason, and because guesswork necessarily plays so large a part in any edition or translation of the Eddic poems, I have risked overloading the pages with textual notes in order to show, as nearly as possible, the exact state of the original together with all the more significant emendations. I have done this particularly in the case of transpositions, many of which appear absolutely necessary, and in the indication of passages which appear to be interpolations.\n\n~<The Verse-Forms of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThe many problems connected with the verse-forms found in the Eddic poems have been analyzed in great detail by Sievers, Neckel, and others. The three verse-forms exemplified in the poems need only a brief comment here, however, in order to make clear the method used in this translation. All of these forms group the lines normally in four-line stanzas. In the so-called Fornyrthislag (\"Old Verse\"), for convenience sometimes referred to in the notes as four-four measure, these lines have all the same",
					
					"structure, each line being sharply divided by a cÃ¦sural pause into two half-lines, and each half-line having two accented syllables and two (sometimes three) unaccented ones. The two half-lines forming a complete line are bound together by the alliteration, or more properly initial-rhyme, of three (or two) of the accented syllables. The following is an example of the Fornyrthislag stanza, the accented syllables being in italics:\n\n\t\t~<VreiÃr~> vas ~<Ving~>ÃÃ³rr, | es ~<vakna~>Ãi\n\t\tok ~<sÃ­ns ham~>ars | of ~<sakna~>Ãi;\n\t\t~<skegg~> nam ~<hris~>ta, | ~<skor~> nam ~<dÃ½~>ja,\n\t\t~<rÃ©~>Ã ~<JarÃ~>ar ~<burr~> | ~<umb~> at ~<Ãreif~>ask.\n\nIn the second form, the Ljothahattr (\"Song Measure\"), the first and third line of each stanza are as just described, but the second and fourth are shorter, have no cÃ¦sural pause, have three accented syllables, and regularly two initial-rhymed accented syllables, for which reason I have occasionally referred to Ljothahattr as four-three measure. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Ar~> skal ~<rÃ­~>sa | sÃ¡s ~<an~>nars ~<vill~>\n\t\t\t~<fÃ©~> eÃa ~<fior haf~>a;\n\t\t~<ligg~>jandi ~<ulfr~> | sjaldan ~<lÃ¡er~> of ~<getr~>\n\t\t\tnÃ© ~<sof~>andi ~<maÃr sigr~>.\n\nIn the third and least commonly used form, the Malahattr (\"Speech Measure\"), a younger verse-form than either of the other two, each line of the four-line stanza is divided into two half-lines by a cÃ¦sural pause, each half line having two accented syllables and three (sometimes",
					
					"four) unaccented ones; the initial rhyme is as in the Fornyrthislag. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Horsk~> vas ~<hÃºs~>freyja, | ~<hug~>Ãi at ~<mann~>viti,\n\t\t~<lag~> heyrÃi ~<Ã³r~>Ãa, | hvat Ã¡ ~<laun mÃ¡el~>tu;\n\t\tÃÃ¡ vas ~<vant vit~>ri, | ~<vil~>di Ãeim ~<hjalÃ~>a:\n\t\tskyldu of ~<sÃ¡e sig~>la, | en ~<sjolf~> nÃ© ~<kvamsk~>at.\n\nA poem in Fornyrthislag is normally entitled -~<kvitha~> (~<Thrymskvitha~>, ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>, etc.), which for convenience I have rendered as \"lay,\" while a poem in Ljothahattr is entitled -~<mol~> (~<Grimnismol~>, ~<Skirnismol~>, etc.), which I have rendered as \"ballad.\" It is difficult to find any distinction other than metrical between the two terms, although it is clear that one originally existed.\n\nVariations frequently appear in all three kinds of verse, and these I have attempted to indicate through the rhythm of the translation. In order to preserve so far as possible the effect of the Eddic verse, I have adhered, in making the English version, to certain of the fundamental rules governing the Norse line and stanza formations. The number of lines to each stanza conforms to what seems the best guess as to the original, and I have consistently retained the number of accented syllables. in translating from a highly inflected language into one depending largely on the use of subsidiary words, it has, however, been necessary to employ considerable freedom as to the number of unaccented syllables in a line. The initial-rhyme is generally confined to two accented syllables in each line. As in the original, all initial vowels are allowed to rhyme interchangeably, but I have disregarded the rule which lets certain groups of consonants rhyme only with themselves",
					
					"(~<e.g.~>, I have allowed initial ~<s~> or ~<st~> to rhyme with ~<sk~> or ~<sl~>). In general, I have sought to preserve the effect of the original form whenever possible without an undue sacrifice of accuracy. For purposes of comparison, the translations of the three stanzas just given are here included:\n\nFornyrthislag:\n\n\t\t~<Wild~> was ~<Ving~>thor | ~<when~> he ~<awoke~>,\n\t\tAnd ~<when~> his ~<might~>y | ~<ham~>mer he ~<missed~>;\n\t\tHe ~<shook~> his ~<beard~>, | his ~<hair~> was ~<brist~>ling,\n\t\tTo ~<grop~>ing ~<set~> | the ~<son~> of ~<Jorth~>.\n\nLjothahattr:\n\n\t\tHe must ~<ear~>ly go ~<forth~> | who ~<fain~> the ~<blood~>\n\t\tOr the ~<goods~> of an~<other~> would ~<get~>;\n\t\tThe ~<wolf~> that lies ~<id~>le | shall ~<win~> little ~<meat~>,\n\t\tOr the ~<sleep~>ing man suc~<cess~>.\n\nMalahattr:\n\n\t\t~<Wise~> was the ~<wom~>an, | she ~<fain~> would use ~<wis~>dom,\n\t\tShe ~<saw~> well what ~<meant~> | all they ~<said~> in ~<sec~>ret; . .\n\t\tFrom her ~<heart~> it was ~<hid~> | how ~<help~> she might ~<ren~>der,\n\t\tThe ~<sea~> they should ~<sail~>, | while her~<self~> she should ~<go~> not.\n\n~<Proper Names~>\n\nThe forms in which the proper names appear in this translation will undoubtedly perplex and annoy those who have become accustomed to one or another of the current methods of anglicising Old Norse names. The nominative ending -r it has seemed best to, omit after consonants, although it has been retained after vowels; in Baldr the final -r is a part of the stem and is of course retained. I",
					
					"have rendered the Norse Ã by \"th\" throughout, instead of spasmodically by \"d,\" as in many texts: ~<e.g.~>, Othin in stead of Odin. For the Norse Ã¸ I have used its equivalent, \"Ã¶,\" ~<e.g.~>, VÃ¶lund; for the o {with a hook} I have used \"o\" and not \"a,\" ~<e.g.~>, Voluspo, not Valuspa or Voluspa. To avoid confusion with accents the long vowel marks of the Icelandic are consistently omitted, as likewise in modern Icelandic proper names. The index at the end of the book indicates the pronunciation in each case.\n\n~<Conclusion~>\n\nThat this translation may be of some value to those who can read the poems of the ~<Edda~> in the original language I earnestly hope. Still more do I wish that it may lead a few who hitherto have given little thought to the Old Norse language and literature to master the tongue for themselves. But far above either of these I place the hope that this English version may give to some, who have known little of the ancient traditions of what is after all their own race, a clearer insight into the glories of that extraordinary past, and that I may through this medium be able to bring to others a small part of the delight which I myself have found in the poems of the ~<Poetic Edda~>.\n\n~<[Wyrmsun Note: The author's explanation of how he translated certain special characters is~> ~<not here properly rendered, as the game is not capable of showing those letters.]~>"

					"~<Voluspo~>\n\n~<The Wise-Woman's Prophecy~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nAt the beginning of the collection in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> stands the Voluspo, the most famous and important, as it is likewise the most debated, of all the Eddic poems. Another version of it is found in a huge miscellaneous compilation of about the year 1300, the ~<Hauksbok~>, and many stanzas are included in the ~<Prose Edda~> of Snorri Sturluson. The order of the stanzas in the ~<Hauksbok~> version differs materially from that in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and in the published editions many experiments have been attempted in further rearrangements. On the whole, how ever, and allowing for certain interpolations, the order of the stanzas in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> seems more logical than any of the wholesale \"improvements\" which have been undertaken.\n\nThe general plan of the ~<Voluspo~> is fairly clear. Othin, chief of the gods, always conscious of impending disaster and eager for knowledge, calls on a certain \"Volva,\" or wise-woman, presumably bidding her rise from the grave. She first tells him of the past, of the creation of the world, the beginning of years, the origin of the dwarfs (at this point there is a clearly interpolated catalogue of dwarfs' names, stanzas 10-16), of the first man and woman, of the world-ash Yggdrasil, and of the first war, between the gods and the Vanir, or, in Anglicized form, the Wanes. Then, in stanzas 27-29, as a further proof of her wisdom, she discloses some of Othin's own secrets and the details of his search for knowledge. Rewarded by Othin for what she has thus far told (stanza 30), she then turns to the real prophesy, the disclosure of the final destruction of the gods. This final battle, in which fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight with their enemies, is the great fact in Norse mythology; the phrase describing it, ~<ragna~> ~<rÃ¶k~>, \"the fate of the gods,\" has become familiar, by confusion with the word rÃ¶kkr, \"twilight,\" in the German ~<GÃ¶terdÃ¤mmerung~>. The wise-woman tells of the Valkyries who bring the slain warriors to support Othin and the other gods in the battle, of the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of the gods, through the wiles of Loki, of the enemies of the gods, of the summons to battle on both sides, and of the mighty struggle, till Othin is slain, and \"fire leaps high",
					
					"about heaven itself\" (stanzas 31-58). But this is not all. A new and beautiful world is to rise on the ruins of the old; Baldr comes back, and \"fields unsowed bear ripened fruit\" (stanzas 59-66).\n\nThis final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments of Finnur Jonsson, MÃ¼llenhoff and others who maintain that the ~<Voluspo~> is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. It seems likely, then, that the ~<Voluspo~> was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the \"Western Isles,\" in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and yet with an imagination active enough to be touched by the vague tales of a different religion emanating from his neighbor Celts.\n\nHow much the poem was altered during the two hundred years between its composition and its first being committed to writing is largely a matter of guesswork, but, allowing for such an obvious interpolation as the catalogue of dwarfs, and for occasional lesser errors, it seems quite needless to assume such great changes as many editors do. The poem was certainly not composed to tell a story with which its early hearers were quite familiar; the lack of continuity which baffles modern readers presumably did not trouble them in the least. It is, in effect, a series of gigantic pictures, put into words with a directness and sureness which bespeak the poet of genius. It is only after the reader, with the help of the many notes, has--familiarized him self with the names and incidents involved that he can begin to understand the effect which this magnificent poem must have produced on those who not only understood but believed it.",

I remember yet | the giants of yore,\nWho gave me bread | in the days gone by;\nNine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree\nWith mighty roots | beneath the mold.\n\n[1. A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify the poem, place stanzas 22, 28 and 30 before stanzas 1-20, but the arrangement in both manuscripts, followed here, seems logical. In stanza I the Volva, or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing. Evidently she be longs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic power. Holy: omitted in ~<Regius~>; the phrase \"holy races\" probably means little more than mankind in general. Heimdall: the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred to as Heimdall's sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall seems to have had various at tributes, and in the Rigsthula, wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men, a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. Rigsthula, introductory prose and note).

Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and the missing passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 9-16), may have explained the \"giant-maids\" otherwise than as Norns.

Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs, running through stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section does not begin before stanza 11. Snorri quotes practically the entire section, the names appearing in a some what changed order. ~<Brimir~> and ~<Blain~>: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested that both are names for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in stanza 37 in connection with the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat the words as common rather than proper nouns, Brimir meaning \"the bloody moisture\" and Blain being of uncertain significance.\n\n10. Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are mentioned elsewhere. It is not clear why Durin should have been singled out as authority for the list. The occasional repetitions suggest that not all the stanzas of the catalogue came from the same source. Most of the names presumably had some definite significance, as Northri, Suthri, Austri, and Vestri (\"North,\" \"South\", \"East,\" and \"West\"),]",

The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise appear in many forms. ~<Regin~>: probably not identical with Regin the son of Hreithmar, who plays an important part in the ~<Reginsmol~> and ~<Fafnismol~>, but cf. note on ~<Reginsmol~>, introductory prose.\n\n14. ~<Dvalin~>: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes to the dwarfs, probably accounting for their skill in craftsmanship, while in ~<Fafnismol~>, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the lesser Norns. The story that some of the dwarfs left the rocks and mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned, but unexplained, in Snorri's Edda; of ~<Lofar~> we know only that he was descended from these wanderers.]",

Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, HÃ¶nir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word \"three\" in stanzas 9 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. ~<Ask~> and ~<Embla~>: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.\n\n18. ~<HÃ¶nir~>: little is known of this god, save that he occasionally appears in the poems in company with Othin and Loki, and]",

He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to the newly created pair.\n\n19. ~<Yggdrasil~>: cf. stanza 2 and note, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 29-35 and notes. Urth (\"The Past\"): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is kept green by being sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her well.\n\n20. ~<The maidens~>: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow stanza 8. ~<Dwelling~>: ~<Regius~> has \"sae\" (sea) instead of \"sal\" (hall, home), and many editors have followed this reading, although Snorri's prose paraphrase indicates \"sal.\" ~<Urth,~> ~<Verthandi~> ~<and~> ~<Skuld~>: \"Past,\" \"Present\" and \"Future.\" ~<Wood~>, etc.: the magic signs (runes) controlling the destinies of men were cut on pieces of wood.

Heith they named her | who sought their home,\nThe wide-seeing witch, | in magic wise;\nMinds she bewitched | that were moved by her magic,\nTo evil women | a joy she was.\n\n[21. This follows stanza 20 in ~<Regius~>; in the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40, and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors have attempted all sorts of rearrangements. ~<The war~>: the first war was that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir) seems to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the southern shores of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway in opposition to the worship of the older gods; hence the \"war.\" Finally the two types of divinities were worshipped in common; hence the treaty which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief among the Wanes were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who seem originally to have been water-deities. ~<I remember~>: the manuscripts have \"she remembers,\" but the Volva is apparently still speaking of her own memories, as in stanza 2. ~<Gollveig~> (\"Gold-Might\"): apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill treatment being the immediate cause of the war. MÃ¼llenhoff maintains that Gollveig is another name for Freyja. Lines 5-6, one or both of them probably interpolated, seem to symbolize the refining of gold by fire. ~<Hor~> (\"The High One\"): Othin.\n\n22. ~<Heith~> (\"Shining One\"?): a name often applied to wise women and prophetesses. The application of this stanza to Gollveig is far from clear, though the reference may be to the]",

It is also possible that the stanza is an interpolation. Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is reciting the poem, and makes it the opening stanza, following it with stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas I ff. The text of line 2 is obscure, and has been variously emended.\n\n23. This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in the manuscripts, for the former describes the battle and the victory of the Wanes, after which the gods took council, debating whether to pay tribute to the victors, or to admit them, as was finally done, to equal rights of worship.\n\n25. Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something lost after stanza 24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to supply transitions which their hearers could generally be counted on to understand. The story referred to in stanzas 25-26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the]",
					
					"26. In swelling rage | then rose up Thor,--\nSeldom he sits | when he such things hears,--\nAnd the oaths were broken, | the words and bonds,\nThe mighty pledges | between them made.\n\n27.

The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him. ~<Oth's~> ~<bride~>: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that Snorri refers to him as a man who \"went away on long journeys.\"\n\n26. ~<Thor~>: the thunder-god, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth) cf. particularly Harbarthsljoth and Thrymskvitha, passim. ~<Oaths~>, etc.: the gods, by violating their oaths to the giant who rebuilt Asgarth, aroused the undying hatred of the giants' race, and thus the giants were among their enemies in the final battle.\n\n27. Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement of some of Othin's own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge (stanzas 27-29). Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 29. ~<The~> ~<horn~> ~<of~> ~<Heimdall~>: the Gjallarhorn (\"Shrieking Horn\"), with which Heimdall, watchman of the gods, will summon them to the last battle. Till that time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil. ~<Valfather's~> ~<pledge~>: Othin's eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange for the latter's wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin's sacrifice of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several differing versions of the story of Othin's relations with Mimir; another one, quite incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the manuscripts ~<I know~> and ~<I see~> appear as \"she knows\" and \"she sees\" (cf. note on 21).]",

The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits all of stanzas 28-34, stanza 27 being there followed by stanzas 40 and 41. ~<Regius~> indicates stanzas 28 and 29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza 22, as the second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why he has come to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for knowledge regarding his doom. Her reiterated \"would you know yet more?\" seems to mean: \"I have proved my wisdom by telling of the past and of your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise of the fate in store for you?\" ~<The Old One~>: Othin.\n\n29. The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural emendation based on Snorri's paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 20.\n\n30. This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva, rewarded by Othin for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1-29), is induced to proceed with her real prophecy (stanzas 31-66). Some editors turn the stanza into the third person, making it a narrative link. Bugge, on the other hand, puts it]",

On all sides saw I | Valkyries assemble,\nReady to ride | to the ranks of the gods;\nSkuld bore the shield, | and Skogul rode next,\nGuth, Hild, Gondul, | and Geirskogul.\nOf Herjan's maidens | the list have ye heard,\nValkyries ready | to ride o'er the earth.\n\n32. I saw for Baldr, | the bleeding god,\nThe son of Othin, | his destiny set:\n\n[after stanza 28 as the third stanza of the poem. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscripts, and editors have attempted various emendations. ~<Heerfather~> (\"Father of the Host\"): Othin.\n\n31. ~<Valkyries~>: these \"Choosers of the Slain\" (cf. stanza I, note) bring the bravest warriors killed in battle to Valhall, in order to re-enforce the gods for their final struggle. They are also called \"Wish-Maidens,\" as the fulfillers of Othin's wishes. The conception of the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of both Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, introductory note), ~<Svava~> (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 17 and note). The list of names here given may be an interpolation; a quite different list is given in ~<Grimnismol~>, 36. ~<Ranks of the gods~>: some editors regard the word thus translated as a specific place name. ~<Herjan~> (\"Leader of Hosts\"): Othin. It is worth noting that the name ~<Hild~> (\"Warrior\") is the basis of Bryn-hild (\"Warrior in Mail Coat\").\n\n32. Baldr: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the first of the great disasters to the gods. The story is fully told by Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created things, saving only the mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling]",
					
					"Famous and fair | in the lofty fields, | Full grown in strength | the mistletoe stood.\n\n33. From the branch which seemed | so slender and fair | Came a harmful shaft | that Hoth should hurl; | But the brother of Baldr | was born ere long, | And one night old | fought Othin's son.\n\n34. His hands he washed not, | his hair he combed not, | Till he bore to the bale-blaze | Baldr's foe. | But in Fensalir | did Frigg weep sore | For Valhall's need: | would you know yet more?\n\n35. One did I see | in the wet woods bound, | A lover of ill, | and to Loki like;\n\n[about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to he a sport for the gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally unharmed thereby. Loki, the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to Baldr's blind brother, Hoth, and guided his hand in hurling the twig. Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf. ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~>.\n\n33. The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in various ways by editors, lacunae having been freely conjectured, but the manuscript version seems clear enough. ~<The~> ~<brother~> ~<of~> ~<Baldr~>: Vali, whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr's death. The day after his birth he fought and slew Hoth.\n\n34. ~<Frigg~>: Othin's wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in ~<Fensalir~> (\"the sea-halls\") symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.\n\n35. The translation here follows the ~<Regius~> version. The ~<Hauksbok~> has the same final two lines, but in place of the first]",

After the murder of Baldr, the gods took Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels of his son Narfi, who had just been torn to pieces by Loki's other son, Vali. A serpent was fastened above Loki's head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki's wife, ~<Sigyn~>, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever the basin was full, and she went away to empty it, then the venom fell on Loki again, till the earth shook with his struggles. \"And there he lies bound till the end.\" Cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, concluding prose.\n\n36. Stanzas 36-39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the giants (36), the dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess Hel (38-39). The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits stanzas 36 and 37. ~<Regius~> unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. ~<Slith~> (\"the Fearful\"): a river in the giants' home. The \"swords and daggers\" may represent the icy cold.\n\n37. ~<Nithavellir~> (\"the Dark Fields\"): a home of the dwarfs.

Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the ~<Hauksbok~> version. Snorri quotes stanzas 39, 39, 40 and 41, though not consecutively. ~<Nastrond~> (\"Corpse-Strand\"): the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess Hel. Here the wicked undergo tortures. ~<Smoke~> ~<vent~>: the phrase gives a picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof serving instead of a chimney.\n\n39. The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is presumably an interpolation, and is lacking in most of the late, paper manuscripts. Some editors, however, have called lines 1-3 the remains of a full. stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines 4-5 the remains of another.

The ~<Hauksbok~> version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain stanza (44), and puts stanzas 40 and 41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza begins the account of the final struggle itself. ~<The giantess~>: her name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in ~<Grimnismol~>, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess and the wolf Fenrir are the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom steals the sun, the second the moon. Some scholars naturally see here an eclipse myth.\n\n41. In the third line many editors omit the comma after \"sun,\" and put one after \"soon,\" making the two lines run: \"Dark grows the sun | in summer soon, / Mighty storms--\" etc. Either phenomenon in summer would be sufficiently striking.\n\n42. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 42 and 43 stand between stanzas 44 and 38. ~<Eggther~>: this giant, who seems to be the watchman of the giants, as Heimdall is that of the gods and Surt of the dwellers in the fire-world, is not mentioned elsewhere in]",

This is a refrain-stanza. In ~<Regius~> it appears in full only at this point, but is repeated in abbreviated form before stanzas 50 and 59. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version the full stanza comes first between stanzas 35 and 42, then, in abbreviated form, it occurs four times: before stanzas 45, 50, 55, and 59.

The serpent was cast into the sea, where he completely encircles the land; cf. especially ~<Hymiskvitha~>, ~<passim~>. ~<The~> ~<eagle~>: the giant HrÃ¦svelg, who sits at the edge of heaven in the form of an eagle, and makes the winds with his wings; cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 37, and ~<Skirnismol~>, 27. ~<Naglfar~>: the ship which was made out of dead men's nails to carry the giants to battle.]",

In anger smites | the warder of earth,-- | Forth from their homes | must all men flee;- | Nine paces fares | the son of Fjorgyn, | And, slain by the serpent, | fearless he sinks.\n\n[54. As quoted by Snorri the first line of this stanza runs: \"Fares Othin's son | to fight with the wolf.\" ~<Sigfather~> (\"Father of Victory\"): Othin. His son, Vithar, is the silent god, famed chiefly for his great shield, and his strength, which is little less than Thor's. He survives the destruction. ~<The~> ~<giant's~> ~<son~>: Fenrir.\n\n55. This and the following stanza are clearly in bad shape. In ~<Regius~> only lines I and 4 are found, combined with stanza 56 as a single stanza. Line I does not appear in the ~<Hauksbok~> version, the stanza there beginning with line 2. Snorri, in quoting these two stanzas, omits 55, 2-4, and 56, 3, making a single stanza out of 55, I, and 56, 4, 2, I, in that order. Moreover, the ~<Hauksbok~> manuscript at this point is practically illegible. The lacuna (line 3) is, of course, purely conjectural, and all sorts of arrangements of the lines have been attempted by editors, ~<Hlothyn~>: another name for Jorth (\"Earth\"), Thor's mother; his father was Othin. ~<The snake~>: Mithgarthsorm; cf. stanza 5c and note. ~<Othin's~> ~<son~>: Thor. The fourth line in ~<Regius~> reads \"against the wolf,\" but if this line refers to Thor at all, and not to Vithar, the ~<Hauksbok~> reading, \"serpent,\" is correct.\n\n56. ~<The~> ~<warder~> ~<of~> ~<earth~>: Thor. ~<The~> ~<son~> ~<of~> ~<Fjorgyn~>: again]",

With this stanza ends the account of the destruction.\n\n58. Again the refrain-stanza (cf. stanza 44 and note), abbreviated in both manuscripts, as in the case of stanza 49. It is probably misplaced here.\n\n59. Here begins the description of the new world which is to rise out of the wreck of the old one. It is on this passage that a few critics have sought to base their argument that the poem is later than the introduction of Christianity (circa 1000), but this theory has never seemed convincing (cf. introductory note).\n\n60.

This stanza is quoted by Snorri. ~<Gimle~>: Snorri makes this the name of the hall itself, while here it appears to refer to a mountain on which the hall stands. It is the home of the happy, as opposed to another hall, not here mentioned, for the dead. Snorri's description of this second hall is based on ~<Voluspo~>, 38, which he quotes, and perhaps that stanza properly belongs after 64.\n\n65. This stanza is not found in ~<Regius~>, and is probably spurious. No lacuna is indicated in the ~<Hauksbok~> version, but late paper manuscripts add two lines, running:\n\n\t\t\"Rule he orders, | and rights he fixes,\n\t\tLaws he ordains | that ever shall live.\"\n\nThe name of this new ruler is nowhere given, and of course the suggestion of Christianity is unavoidable. It is not certain, how ever, that even this stanza refers to Christianity, and if it does, it may have been interpolated long after the rest of the poem was composed.\n\n66. This stanza, which fits so badly with the preceding ones,",
					
					"may well have been interpolated. It has been suggested that the dragon, making a last attempt to rise, is destroyed, this event marking the end of evil in the world. But in both manuscripts the final half-line does not refer to the dragon, but, as the gender shows, to the Volva herself, who sinks into the earth; a sort of conclusion to the entire prophecy. Presumably the stanza (barring the last half-line, which was probably intended as the conclusion of the poem) belongs somewhere in the description of the great struggle. ~<Nithhogg~>: the dragon at the roots of Yggdrasil; cf. stanza 39 and note. ~<Nithafjoll~> (\"the Dark Crags\"); nowhere else mentioned. ~<Must~> ~<I~>: the manuscripts have \"must she.\"]"

					"~<Hovamol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of the High One~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThis poem follows the ~<Voluspo~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, but is preserved in no other manuscript. The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and two lines of stanza 84 appear in one of the sagas.\n\nIn its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other of the Eddic poems. Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened seems to have been somewhat as follows. There existed from very early times a collection of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical proverbs were to Solomon. This collection, which presumably was always elastic in extent, was known as \"The High One's Words,\" and forms the basis of the present poem. To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin. Thus a catalogue of runes, or charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from those comprising the main collection. Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter to insert new stanzas almost at will. This curious miscellany is what we now have as the ~<Hovamol~>.\n\nFive separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the ~<Hovamol~> proper (stanzas 1-80), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life; (2) the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (stanzas 111-138), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specific ally addressed to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing's daughter (stanzas 96-102), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness of women in general (stanzas 81-95), which probably crept into the poem first, and then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin got the mead of poetry--the draught which gave him the gift of tongues--from the maiden Gunnloth (stanzas 103-110). There is also a brief passage (stanzas 139 146) telling how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the ~<Ljothatal~>, and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason.",
					
					"It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this. Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts of it may have originated at a relatively late period. Probably, however, most of its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how or when they first became associated.\n\nIt seems all but meaningless to talk about \"interpolations\" in a poem which has developed almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and ends. The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main divisions of the poem distinct.\n\nFew gnomic collections in the world's literary history present sounder wisdom more tersely expressed than the Hovamol. Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry. If it presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty, truth, and unfaltering courage.\n\n1. Within the gates | ere a man shall go,\n(Full warily let him watch,)\nFull long let him look about him;\nFor little he knows | where a foe may lurk,\nAnd sit in the seats within.\n\n2. Hail to the giver! | a guest has come;\nWhere shall the stranger sit?\nSwift shall he be who, | with swords shall try\nThe proof of his might to make.\n\n[1. This stanza is quoted by Snorri, the second line being omitted in most of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~> manuscripts.\n\n2. Probably the first and second lines had originally nothing to do with the third and fourth, the last two not referring to host or guest, but to the general danger of backing one's views with the sword.]",
					
					"3. Fire he needs | who with frozen knees\nHas come from the cold without;\nFood and clothes | must the farer have,\nThe man from the mountains come.\n\n4. Water and towels | and welcoming speech\nShould he find who comes, to the feast;\nIf renown he would get, | and again be greeted,\nWisely and well must he act.\n\n5. Wits must he have | who wanders wide,\nBut all is easy at home;\nAt the witless man | the wise shall wink\nWhen among such men he sits.\n\n6. A man shall not boast | of his keenness of mind,\nBut keep it close in his breast;\nTo the silent and wise | does ill come seldom\nWhen he goes as guest to a house;\n(For a faster friend | one never finds\nThan wisdom tried and true.)\n\n7. The knowing guest | who goes to the feast,\nIn silent attention sits;\nWith his ears he hears, | with his eyes he watches,\nThus wary are wise men all.\n\n[6. Lines 5 and 6 appear to have been added to the stanza.]",

Happy the man | who has while he lives\nWisdom and praise as well,\nFor evil counsel | a man full oft\nHas from another's heart.\n\n10. A better burden | may no man bear\nFor wanderings wide than wisdom;\nIt is better than wealth | on unknown ways,\nAnd in grief a refuge it gives.\n\n11. A better burden | may no man bear\nFor wanderings wide than wisdom;\nWorse food for the journey | he brings not afield\nThan an over-drinking of ale.\n\n12. Less good there lies | than most believe\nIn ale for mortal men;\nFor the more he drinks | the less does man\nOf his mind the mastery hold.\n\n[12. Some editors have combined this stanza in various ways with the last two lines of stanza it, as in the manuscript the first two lines of the latter are abbreviated, and, if they belong there at all, are presumably identical with the first two lines of stanza 10.]",
					
					"13. Over beer the bird | of forgetfulness broods,\nAnd steals the minds of men;\nWith the heron's feathers | fettered I lay\nAnd in Gunnloth's house was held.\n\n14.

The herds know well | when home they shall fare,\nAnd then from the grass they go;\nBut the foolish man | his belly's measure\nShall never know aright.\n\n22.

Wise a guest holds it | to take to his heels,\nWhen mock of another he makes;\nBut little he knows | who laughs at the feast,\nThough he mocks in the midst of his foes.\n\n32. Friendly of mind | are many men,\nTill feasting they mock at their friends;\nTo mankind a bane | must it ever be\nWhen guests together strive.\n\n33. Oft should one make | an early meal,\nNor fasting come to the feast;\nElse he sits and chews | as if he would choke,\nAnd little is able to ask.\n\n34.

Fire for men | is the fairest gift,\nAnd power to see the sun;\nHealth as well, | if a man may have it,\nAnd a life not stained with sin.\n\n69. All wretched is no man, | though never so sick;\nSome from their sons have joy,\nSome win it from kinsmen, | and some from their wealth,\nAnd some from worthy works.\n\n70. It is better to live | than to lie a corpse,\nThe live man catches the cow;\nI saw flames rise | for the rich man's pyre,\nAnd before his door he lay dead.\n\n71. The lame rides a horse, | the handless is herdsman,\nThe deaf in battle is bold;\nThe blind man is better | than one that is burned,\nNo good can come of a corpse.\n\n[70. The manuscript has \"and a worthy life\" in place of \"than to lie a corpse\" in line I, but Rask suggested the emendation as early as 1818, and most editors have followed him.]",
					
					"72. A son is better, | though late he be born,\nAnd his father to death have fared;\nMemory-stones | seldom stand by the road\nSave when kinsman honors his kin.\n\n73. Two make a battle, | the tongue slays the head;\nIn each furry coat | a fist I look for.\n\n74. He welcomes the night | whose fare is enough,\n(Short are the yards of a ship,)\nUneasy are autumn nights;\nFull oft does the weather | change in a week,\nAnd more in a month's time.\n\n75. A man knows not, | if nothing he knows,\nThat gold oft apes begets;\nOne man is wealthy | and one is poor,\nYet scorn for him none should know.\n\n76. Among Fitjung's sons | saw I well-stocked folds,--\nNow bear they the beggar's staff;\n\n[73-74. These seven lines are obviously a jumble. The two lines of stanza 73 not only appear out of place, but the verse form is unlike that of the surrounding stanzas. In 74, the second line is clearly interpolated, and line I has little enough connection with lines 3, 4 and 5. It looks as though some compiler (or copyist) had inserted here various odds and ends for which he could find no better place.\n\n75. The word \"gold\" in line 2 is more or less conjectural, the manuscript being obscure. The reading in line 4 is also doubtful.]",

Certain is that | which is sought from runes,\nThat the gods so great have made,\nAnd the Master-Poet painted;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . of the race of gods:\nSilence is safest and best.\n\n80. An unwise man, | if a maiden's love\nOr wealth he chances to win,\n\n[76. in the manuscript this stanza follows 79, the order being: 77, 78, 76, 80, 79, 81. ~<Fitjung~> (\"the Nourisher\"): Earth.\n\n79. This stanza is certainly in bad shape, and probably out of place here. Its reference to runes as magic signs suggests that it properly belongs in some list of charms like the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165). The stanza-form is so irregular as to show either that something has been lost or that there have been interpolations. The manuscript indicates no lacuna; Gering fills out the assumed gap as follows:\n\n\t\t\"Certain is that which is sought from runes,\n\t\tThe runes--,\" etc.\n]",
					
					"His pride will wax, but his wisdom never,\nStraight forward he fares in conceit.\n\n~<* * *~>\n\n81. Give praise to the day at evening, | to a woman on her pyre,\nTo a weapon which is tried, | to a maid at wed lock,\nTo ice when it is crossed, | to ale that is drunk.\n\n82. When the gale blows hew wood, | in fair winds seek the water;\nSport with maidens at dusk, | for day's eyes are many;\nFrom the ship seek swiftness, | from the shield protection,\nCuts from the sword, | from the maiden kisses.\n\n83. By the fire drink ale, | over ice go on skates;\nBuy a steed that is lean, | and a sword when tarnished,\n\n[81. With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes to Malahattr. What has happened seems to have been something like this. Stanza 80 introduces the idea of man's love for woman. Consequently some reciter or compiler (or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas concerning the ways of women. Thus stanza 80 would account for the introduction of stanzas 81 and 82, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza 83 in with them. Stanza 84 suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed--again with a change of verse-form--by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas 85-90). Then, after a few more stanzas on love in the regular measure of the ~<Hovamol~> (stanza 91-9s), is introduced, by way of illustration, Othin's story of his]",

Some such process of growth, whatever its specific stages may have been, must be assumed to account for the curious chaos of the whole passage from stanza 81 to stanza 102.\n\n84. Lines 3 and 4 are quoted in the ~<FostbrÃ¦thrasaga~>.\n\n85. Stanzas 85-88 and go are in Fornyrthislag, and clearly come from a different source from the rest of the ~<Hovamol~>.\n\n87. The stanza is doubtless incomplete. Some editors add from a late paper manuscript two lines running: \"In a light, clear sky | or a laughing throng, / In the bowl of a dog | or a harlot's grief!\"]", -- had to condense verses in the footnotes into a single line

This stanza follows stanza 89 in the manuscript. Many editors have changed the order, for while stanza 89 is pretty clearly an interpolation wherever it stands, it seriously interferes with the sense if it breaks in between 87 and 88.]",

					"93. Fault for loving | let no man find\nEver with any other;\nOft the wise are fettered, | where fools go free,\nBy beauty that breeds desire.\n\n94. Fault with another | let no man find\nFor what touches many a man;\nWise men oft | into witless fools\nAre made by mighty love.\n\n95.

Billing's daughter | I found on her bed,\nIn slumber bright as the sun;\nEmpty appeared | an earl's estate\nWithout that form so fair.\n\n[96. Here begins the passage (stanzas 96-102) illustrating the falseness of woman by the story of Othin's unsuccessful love affair with Billing's daughter. Of this person we know nothing beyond what is here told, but the story needs little comment.]",

					"98. \"Othin, again | at evening come,\nIf a woman thou wouldst win;\nEvil it were | if others than we\nShould know of such a sin.\"\n\n99. Away I hastened, | hoping for joy,\nAnd careless of counsel wise;\nWell I believed | that soon I should win\nMeasureless joy with the maid.\n\n100. So came I next | when night it was,\nThe warriors all were awake;\nWith burning lights | and waving brands\nI learned my luckess way.\n\n101.

Many fair maids, | if a man but tries them,\nFalse to a lover are found;\nThat did I learn | when I longed to gain\nWith wiles the maiden wise;\n\n[102. Rask adds at the beginning of this stanza two lines from a late paper manuscript, running:\n\n\"Few are so good | that false they are never\nTo cheat the mind of a man.\"\n\nHe makes these two lines plus lines I and 2 a full stanza, and line 3, 4, 5, and 6 a second stanza.]",

I found the old giant, | now back have I fared,\nSmall gain from silence I got;\nFull many a word, | my will to get,\nI spoke in Suttung's hall.\n\n105. The mouth of Rati | made room for my passage,\nAnd space in the stone he gnawed;\n\n[103. With this stanza the subject changes abruptly, and apparently the virtues of fair speech, mentioned in the last three lines, account for the introduction, from what source cannot be known, of the story of Othin and the mead of song (stanzas 104-110).\n\n104. The giant ~<Suttung~> (\"the old giant\") possessed the magic mead, a draught of which conferred the gift of poetry. Othin, desiring to obtain it, changed himself into a snake, bored his way through a mountain into Suttung's home, made love to the giant's daughter, Gunnloth, and by her connivance drank up all the mead. Then he flew away in the form of an eagle, leaving Gunnloth to her fate. While with Suttung he assumed the name of Bolverk (\"the Evil-Doer\").\n\n105. ~<Rati~> (\"the Traveller\"): the gimlet with which Othin bored through the mountain to reach Suttung's home.]",

					"Above and below | the giants' paths lay,\nSo rashly I risked my head.\n\n106. Gunnloth gave | on a golden stool\nA drink of the marvelous mead;\nA harsh reward | did I let her have\nFor her heroic heart,\nAnd her spirit troubled sore.\n\n107. The well-earned beauty | well I enjoyed,\nLittle the wise man lacks;\nSo OthrÃ¶rir now | has up been brought\nTo the midst of the men of earth.\n\n108. Hardly, methinks, | would I home have come,\nAnd left the giants' land,\nHad not Gunnloth helped me, | the maiden good,\nWhose arms about me had been.\n\n109. The day that followed, | the frost-giants came,\nSome word of Hor to win,\n(And into the hall of Hor;)\n\n[106. Probably either the fourth or the fifth line is a spurious addition.\n\n107. ~<OthrÃ¶rir~>: here the name of the magic mead itself, whereas in stanza 141 it is the name of the vessel containing it. Othin had no intention of bestowing any of the precious mead upon men, but as he was flying over the earth, hotly pursued by Suttung, he spilled some of it out of his mouth, and in this way mankind also won the gift of poetry.\n\n108. ~<Hor~>: Othin (\"the High One\"). The frost-giants, Suttung's kinsmen, appear not to have suspected Othin of being]",

					"Of Bolverk they asked, | were he back midst the gods,\nOr had Suttung slain him there?\n\n110. On his ring swore Othin | the oath, methinks;\nWho now his troth shall trust?\nSuttung's betrayal | he sought with drink,\nAnd Gunnloth to grief he left.\n\n~<* * *~>\n\n111. It is time to chant | from the chanter's stool;\nBy the wells of Urth I was,\nI saw and was silent, | I saw and thought,\nAnd heard the speech of Hor.\n(Of runes heard I words, | nor were counsels wanting,\nAt the hall of Hor,\nIn the hall of Hor;\nSuch was the speech I heard.)\n\n[identical with Bolverk, possibly because the oath referred to in stanza I to was an oath made by Othin to Suttung that there was no such person as Bolverk among the gods. The giants, of course, fail to get from Othin the information they seek concerning Bolverk, but Othin is keenly conscious of having violated the most sacred of oaths, that sworn on his ring.\n\n111. With this stanza begins the Loddfafnismol (stanzas 111-138). Loddfafnir is apparently a wandering singer, who, from his \"chanter's stool,\" recites the verses which he claims to have received from Othin. ~<Wells of Urth~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 19 and note. Urth (\"the Past\") is one of the three Norns. This stanza is apparently in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting lines as spurious and in rearranging the words and punctuation. It looks rather as though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had crept in later. The phrase translated \"the speech of Hor\" is \"Hova mol,\" later used as the title for the entire poem.]",

Lines 1-3 are the formula, repeated (abbreviated in the manuscript) in most of the stanzas, with which Othin prefaces his counsels to Loddfafnir, and throughout this section, except in stanzas 111 and 138, Loddfafnir represents himself as simply quoting Othin's words. The material is closely analogous to that contained in the first eighty stanzas of the poem. In some cases (e. g., stanzas 117, 119, 121, 126 and 130) the formula precedes a full four-line stanza instead of two (or three) lines.]",

This stanza suggests the dangers of too much hospitality. The beam (bolt) which is ever being raised to admit guests be comes weak thereby. It needs a ring to help it in keeping the door closed, and without the ability at times to ward off guests a man becomes the victim of his own generosity.\n\n137. The list of \"household remedies\" in this stanza is doubtless interpolated. Their nature needs no comment here.]",

In the manuscript this stanza comes at the end of the entire poem, following stanza 165. Most recent editors have followed MÃ¼llenhoff in shifting it to this position, as it appears to conclude the passage introduced by the somewhat similar stanza 111.\n\n139. With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the ~<Hovamol~>: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the Ljothatal, or list of charms. Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: \"Othin's Tale of the Runes.\" Apparently stanzas 139, 140 and 142 are fragments of an account of how Othin obtained the runes; 141 is erroneously inserted from some version of the magic mead story (cf. stanzas 104-110); and stanzas 143, 144, 145, and 146 are from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes. With stanza 147 a clearly continuous passage begins once more. ~<The windy tree~>: the ash Yggdrasil (literally \"the Horse of Othin,\" so called be cause of this story), on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to himself, and wounded himself with his own spear. Lines 5 and 6 have presumably been borrowed from ~<Svipdagsmol~>, 30.]",

					"140. None made me happy | with loaf or horn,\nAnd there below I looked;\nI took up the runes, | shrieking I took them,\nAnd forthwith back I fell.\n\n141. Nine mighty songs | I got from the son\nOf Bolthorn, Bestla's father;\nAnd a drink I got | of the goodly mead\nPoured out from OthrÃ¶rir.\n\n142. Then began I to thrive, | and wisdom to get,\nI grew and well I was;\nEach word led me on | to another word,\nEach deed to another deed.\n\n143. Runes shalt thou find, | and fateful signs,\nThat the king of singers colored,\nAnd the mighty gods have made;\n\n[141. This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin's winning the runes, appears to be an interpolation. The meaning of the stanza is most obscure. Bolthorn was Othin's grandfather, and Bestla his mother. We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned, but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 27 and note, and 47 and note). In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas 104-110). Concerning ~<OthrÃ¶rir~>, here used as the name of the vessel containing the mead, cf. stanza 107 and note.\n\n143. This and the following stanza belong together, and in many editions appear as a single stanza. They presumably come from some lost poem on the authorship of the runes. Lines 2 and 3 follow line 4 in the manuscript; the transposition was suggested by Bugge. ~<The~> ~<king~> ~<of~> ~<singers~>: Othin. The magic signs (runes) were commonly carved in wood, then colored red.]",

Dain, however, may here be one of the elves rather than the dwarf of that name. The two names also appear together in ~<Grimnismol~>, 33, where they are applied to two of the four harts that nibble at the topmost twigs of Yggdrasil. ~<Alsvith~> (\"the All Wise\") appears nowhere else as a giant's name. ~<Myself~>: Othin. We have no further information concerning the list of those who wrote the runes for the various races, and these four lines seem like a confusion of names in the rather hazy mind of some reciter.\n\n145. This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with the runes which one \"writes\" and \"tints\" (cf. stanza 79) than with the prayers which one \"asks\" and the sacrifices which one \"offers\" and \"sends.\" Its origin is wholly uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here. In the manuscript the phrase \"knowest?\" is abbreviated after the first line.]",

The last two lines are almost certainly misplaced; Bugge suggests that they belong at the end of stanza 144. ~<Thund~>: another name for Othin. ~<When~> ~<home~> ~<he~> ~<came~>: presumably after obtaining the runes as described in stanzas 139 and 140.\n\n147. With this stanza begins the ~<Ljothatal~>, or list of charms. The magic songs themselves are not given, but in each case the peculiar application of the charm is explained. The passage, which is certainly approximately complete as far as it goes, runs to the end of the poem. In the manuscript and in most editions line 4 falls into two half-lines, running:\n\n\"In sickness and pain | and every sorrow.\"\n]",

					"149. A third I know, | if great is my need\nOf fetters to hold my foe;\nBlunt do I make | mine enemy's blade,\nNor bites his sword or staff.\n\n150. A fourth I know, | if men shall fasten\nBonds on my bended legs;\nSo great is the charm | that forth I may go,\nThe fetters spring from my feet,\nBroken the bonds from my hands.\n\n151. A fifth I know, | if I see from afar\nAn arrow fly 'gainst the folk;\nIt flies not so swift | that I stop it not,\nIf ever my eyes behold it.\n\n152. A sixth I know, | if harm one seeks\nWith a sapling's roots to send me;\nThe hero himself | who wreaks his hate\nShall taste the ill ere I.\n\n153. A seventh I know, | if I see in flames\nThe hall o'er my comrades' heads;\nIt burns not so wide | that I will not quench it,\nI know that song to sing.\n\n[148. ~<Second~>, etc., appear in the manuscript as Roman numerals. The manuscript indicates no gap after line 2.\n\n152. The sending of a root with runes written thereon was an excellent way of causing death. So died the Icelandic hero Grettir the Strong.]",

Possibly one of the last two lines is spurious.\n\n157. The last line looks like an unwarranted addition, and line 4 may likewise be spurious.\n\n158. Lines 4-5 are probably expanded from a single line.]",

The sprinkling of a child with water was an established custom long before Christianity brought its conception of baptism.\n\n161. This stanza, according to MÃ¼llenhoff, was the original conclusion of the poem, the phrase \"a fifteenth\" being inserted only after stanzas 162-165 had crept in. ~<Delling~>: a seldom mentioned god who married Not (Night). Their son was Dag (Day). ~<ThjothrÃ¶rir~>: not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Hroptatyr~>: Othin.]",

Some editors have combined these two lines with stanza 164. Others have assumed that the gap follows the first half-line, making \"so that-from me\" the end of the stanza.\n\n164. This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, and seems to have been introduced after the list of charms and the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (stanzas 111-138) were combined in a single poem, for there is no other apparent excuse for the reference to Loddfafnir at this point. The words \"if thou mightest get them\" are a conjectural emendation.\n\n165. This stanza is almost totally obscure. The third and fourth lines look like interpolations.]"

					"~<Vafthruthnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Vafthruthnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Vafthruthnismol follows the Hovamol in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~>, the first part evidently having appeared on leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.\n\nThe poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god's turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: \"What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?\" Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.\n\nThe whole poem is essentially encyclopÃ¦dic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. The encyclopÃ¦dic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the ~<Grimnismol~> and the much later ~<Alvissmol~> represent different phases of the same type. The ~<Vafthruthnismol~> and ~<Grimnismol~> together, in deed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the ~<Voluspo~>: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition.",

Probably another form of the name, Dogling, meaning \"Son of the Dew\" is more correct): the husband of Not (Night); their son was Dag (Day); cf. Hovamol, 161. Nor: Snorri calls the father of Night Norvi or Narfi, and puts him among the giants. Lines 3-4: cf. Voluspo, 6.\n\n27. Neither the ~<Regius~> nor the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an Codex~> indicates a lacuna. Most editors have filled out the stanza with two lines from late paper manuscripts: \"And both of these shall ever be, / Till the gods to destruction go.\" Bugge ingeniously paraphrases Snorri's prose: \"Vindsval's father was Vosuth called, / And rough is all his race.\" ~<Vindsval~>: \"the Wind-Cold,\" also called Vindljoni, \"the Wind-Man.\" ~<Svosuth~>: \"the Gentle.\"]",

Of ~<Thruthgelmir~> (\"the Mightily Burning\") we know nothing, but Aurgelmir was the frost-giants' name for Ymir himself. Thus Ymir was the first of the giants, and so Othin's question is answered.\n\n31. Snorri quotes {illegible}is stanza, and the last two lines are taken from his version, as both of the manuscripts omit them. ~<Elivagar~> (\"Stormy Waves\"): Mogk suggests that this river may have been the Milky Way.

Snorri gives, without materially elaborating on it, the same account of how Ymir's son and daughter were born under his left arm, and how his feet together created a son. That this offspring should have had six heads is nothing out of the ordinary, for various giants had more than the normal number, and Ymir's mother is credited with a little matter of nine hundred heads; cf. ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 8. Of the career of Ymir's six headed son we know nothing; he may have been the Thruthgelmir of stanza 29.]",

					"~<Grimnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Grimnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Grimnismol~> follows the ~<Vafthruthnismol~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> and is also found complete in the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~>, where also it follows the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Snorri quotes over twenty of its stanzas.\n\nLike the preceding poem, the ~<Grimnismol~> is largely encyclopedic in nature, and consists chiefly of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As MÃ¼llenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. Othin, concealed under the name of Grimnir, is through an error tortured by King GeirrÃ¶th. Bound between two blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king's little son, Agnar, who has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true name, or rather names, to the terrified GeirrÃ¶th, and the latter falls on his sward and is killed.\n\nFor much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose statement of the manner of GeirrÃ¶th's death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.\n\nWithout discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories",
					
					"themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story telling, and in some of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose \"links\" between dialogue stanzas.\n\nThe applications of this fact, which has been too often over looked, are almost limitless, for it suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called \"popular\" epic. It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages before such a poem as the ~<Iliad~>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.\n\nInterpolations in such a poem as the ~<Grimnismol~> could have been made easily enough, and many stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.\n\nKing Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other GeirrÃ¶th. Agnar was ten winters old, and GeirrÃ¶th eight. Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for\n\n[Prose. The texts of the two manuscripts differ in many minor details. ~<Hrauthung~>: this mythical king is not mentioned elsewhere. ~<GeirrÃ¶th~>: the manuscripts spell his name in various ways]",
					
					"GeirrÃ¶th, and taught him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with GeirrÃ¶th. They had a fair wind, and came to their father's landing-place. GeirrÃ¶th was forward in the boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, \"Go thou now where evil may have thee!\" The boat drifted out to sea. GeirrÃ¶th, however, went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then GeirrÃ¶th was made king, and became a renowned man.\n\nOthin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. Othin said: \"Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave? But GeirrÃ¶th, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.\" Frigg said: \"He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come to him.\" Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about this matter. Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to GeirrÃ¶th. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that King GeirrÃ¶th was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself Grimnir, but said no more about himself, though\n\n[~<Frigg~>: Othin's wife. She and Othin nearly always disagreed in some such way as the one outlined in this story. ~<Hlithskjolf~> (\"Gate-Shelf\"): Othin's watch-tower in heaven, whence he can overlook all the nine worlds; cf. ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<Grimnir~>: \"the Hooded One.\"]",
					
					"he was questioned. The king had him tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there eight nights. King GeirrÃ¶th had a son ten winters old, and called Agnar after his father's brother. Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented with out cause. Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on Grimnir's back. He spake:\n\n1. Hot art thou, fire! | too fierce by far;\nGet ye now gone, ye flames!\nThe mantle is burnt, | though I bear it aloft,\nAnd the fire scorches the fur.\n\n2. 'Twixt the fires now | eight nights have I sat,\nAnd no man brought meat to me,\nSave Agnar alone, | and alone shall rule\nGeirrÃ¶th's son o'er the Goths.\n\n3. Hail to thee, Agnar! | for hailed thou art\nBy the voice of Veratyr;\n\n[2. In the original lines 2 and 4 are both too long for the meter, and thus the true form of the stanza is doubtful. For line 4 both manuscripts have \"the land of the Goths\" instead of simply \"the Goths.\" The word \"Goths\" apparently was applied indiscriminately to any South-Germanic people, including the Burgundians as well as the actual Goths, and thus here has no specific application; cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 35 and note.]",

The god, or rather Wane, Njorth (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 21, note) married Thjazi's daughter, Skathi. She wished to live in her father's hall among the mountains, while Njorth loved his home, Noatun, by the sea. They agreed to compromise by spending nine nights at Thrymheim and then three at Noatun, but neither could endure the surroundings of the other's home, so Skathi returned to Thrymheim, while Njorth stayed at Noatun. Snorri quotes stanzas 11-15.\n\n12. ~<Breithablik~> (\"Wide-Shining\"): the house in heaven, free from everything unclean, in which Baldr (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 32, note), the fairest and best of the gods, lived.\n\n13. ~<Himinbjorg~> (\"Heaven's Cliffs\"): the dwelling at the end of the bridge Bifrost (the rainbow), where Heimdall (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 27) keeps watch against the coming of the giants. In this stanza the two functions of Heimdall--as father of mankind (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 1 and note, and ~<Rigsthula~>, introductory prose and note) and as warder of the gods--seem both to be mentioned, but the second line in the manuscripts is apparently in bad shape, and in the editions is more or less conjectural.\n\n14. ~<Folkvang~> (\"Field of the Folk): here is situated Freyja's]",

Freyja, the sister of Freyr, is the fairest of the goddesses, and the most kindly disposed to mankind, especially to lovers. ~<Half~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<dead~>: Mogk has made it clear that Freyja represents a confusion between two originally distinct divinities: the wife of Othin (Frigg) and the northern goddess of love. This passage appears to have in mind her attributes as Othin's wife. Snorri has this same confusion, but there is no reason why the Freyja who was Freyr's sister should share the slain with Othin.\n\n15. ~<Glitnir~> (\"the Shining\"): the home of Forseti, a god of whom we know nothing beyond what Snorri tells us: \"Forseti is the son of Baldr and Nanna, daughter of Nep. All those who come to him with hard cases to settle go away satisfied; he is the best judge among gods and men.\"\n\n16. ~<Noatun~> (\"Ships'-Haven\"): the home of Njorth, who calms the waves; cf. stanza 11 and ~<Voluspo~>, 21.\n\n17. ~<Vithi~>: this land is not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Vithar~> avenged his father, Othin, by slaying the wolf Fenrir.]",

His flesh suffices for all the heroes there gathered, and each evening he becomes whole again, to be cooked the next morning.\n\n19. ~<Freki~> (\"The Greedy\") and ~<Geri~> (\"The Ravenous\"): the two wolves who sit by Othin's side at the feast, and to whom he gives all the food set before him, since wine is food and drink alike for him. ~<Heerfather~>: Othin. 20, ~<Mithgarth~> (\"The Middle Home\"): the earth. ~<Hugin~> (\"Thought\") and ~<Munin~> (\"Memory\"): the two ravens who sit on Othin's shoulders, and fly forth daily to bring him news of the world.]",

The last two lines refer to the attack on Valhall by the people of Hel; cf. Voluspo, 51.\n\n22. ~<Valgrind~> (\"The Death-Gate\"): the outer gate of Valhall; cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, 68 and note.\n\n23. This and the following stanza stand in reversed order in ~<Regius~>. Snorri quotes stanza 23 as a proof of the vast size of Valhall. The last two lines refer to the final battle with Fenrir and the other enemies.\n\n24.

Snorri quotes the stanza in his account of Thor.\n\n25. The first line in the original is, as indicated in the translation, too long, and various attempts to amend it have been made. ~<Heithrun~>: the she-goat who lives on the twigs of the tree ~<LÃ¦rath~> (presumably the ash Yggdrasil), and daily gives mead which, like the boar's flesh, suffices for all the heroes in Valhall. In Snorri's ~<Edda~> Gangleri foolishly asks whether the heroes drink water, whereto Har replies, \"Do you imagine that Othin invites kings and earls and other noble men, and then gives them water to drink?\"\n\n26. Eikthyrnir (\"The Oak-Thorned,\" i.e., with antlers, \"thorns,\" like an oak): this animal presumably represents the clouds. The first line, like that of stanza 25, is too long in the original. ~<LÃ¦rath~>: cf. stanza 25, note. ~<Hvergelmir~>: according to Snorri, this spring, \"the Cauldron-Roaring,\" was in the midst of Niflheim, the world of darkness and the dead, beneath the third root of the ash Yggdrasil.

The entire passage from stanza 27 through stanza 35 is confused. The whole thing may well be an interpolation. Bugge calls stanzas 27-30 an interpolation, and editors who have accepted the passage as a whole have rejected various lines. The spelling of the names of the rivers varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions. It is needless here to point out the many attempted emendations of this list. For a passage presenting similar problems, cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 10-16. Snorri virtually quotes stanzas 27-29 in his prose, though not consecutively. The name ~<Rin~>, in line 3, is identical with that for the River Rhine which appears frequently in the hero poems, but the similarity is doubt less purely accidental.\n\n28. ~<Slith~> may possibly be the same river as that mentioned in Voluspo, 36, as flowing through the giants' land. ~<Leipt~>: in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~>, 29, this river is mentioned as one by which a solemn oath is sworn, and Gering points the parallel to the significance of the Styx among the Greeks. The other rivers here named are not mentioned elsewhere in the poems.]",

This stanza looks as though it originally had had nothing to do with the two preceding it. Snorri quotes it in his description of the three roots of Yggdrasil, and the three springs be neath them. \"The third root of the ash stands in heaven and beneath this root is a spring which is very holy, and is called Urth's well.\" (Cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 19) \"There the gods have their judgment-seat, and thither they ride each day over Bifrost, which is also called the Gods' Bridge.\" Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun. Nothing more is known of the rivers named in this stanza. Lines 3-4 are almost certainly interpolated from stanza 30.\n\n30. This stanza, again possibly an interpolation, is closely paraphrased by Snorri following the passage quoted in the previous note. ~<Glath~> (\"Joyous\"): identified in the ~<Skaldskaparmal~> with Skinfaxi, the horse of day; cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 12. ~<Gyllir~>: \"Golden.\" ~<Gler~>: \"Shining.\" ~<Skeithbrimir~>: \"Swift-Going.\" ~<Silfrintopp~>: \"Silver-Topped.\" Sinir: \"Sinewy.\" ~<Gisl~>: the meaning is doubtful; Gering suggests \"Gleaming.\" ~<Falhofnir~>:]",

The first of these roots is the one referred to in stanza 26; the second in stanza 29 (cf. notes). Of the third root there is nothing noteworthy recorded. After this stanza it is more than possible that one has been lost, paraphrased in the prose of Snorri's Edda thus: \"An eagle sits in the branches of the ash tree, and he is very wise; and between his eyes sits the hawk who is called Vethrfolnir.\"\n\n32. ~<Ratatosk~> (\"The Swift-Tusked\"): concerning this squirrel, the Prose Edda has to add only that he runs up and down the tree conveying the abusive language of the eagle (see note on stanza 31) and the dragon ~<Nithhogg~> (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 39 and note) to each other. The hypothesis that Ratatosk \"represents the undying hatred between the sustaining and the destroying elements-the gods and the giants,\" seems a trifle far-fetched.\n\n33.

Voluspo, 31 and note, where a different list of names is given. ~<Hrist~>: \"Shaker.\" ~<Mist~>: \"Mist.\" ~<Skeggjold~>: \"Ax-Time.\" ~<Skogul~>: \"Raging\" (?). ~<Hild~>: \"Warrior.\" ~<Thruth~>: \"Might.\" ~<Hlok~>: \"Shrieking.\" ~<Herfjotur~>: \"Host-Fetter.\" ~<Gol~>: \"Screaming.\" ~<Geironul~>: \"Spear-Bearer.\" ~<Randgrith~>: \"Shield-Bearer.\" ~<Rathgrith~>: Gering guesses \"Plan-Destroyer.\" ~<Reginleif~>: \"Gods'-Kin.\" Manuscripts and editions vary greatly in the spelling of these names, and hence in their significance.\n\n37. MÃ¼llenhoff suspects stanzas 37-41 to have been interpolated, and Edzardi thinks they may have come from the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Snorri closely paraphrases stanzas 37-39, and quotes 40-41. ~<Arvak~> (\"Early Waker\") and ~<Alsvith~> (\"All Swift\"): the horses of the sun, named also in ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 15. According to Snorri: \"There was a man called Mundilfari, who had two children; they were so fair and lovely that he called his son Mani and his daughter Sol. The gods were angry at this presumption, and took the children and set them up in heaven; and they bade Sol drive the horses that drew the car of the sun]",
					
					"38. In front of the sun | does Svalin stand,\nThe shield for the shining god;\nMountains and sea | would be set in flames\nIf it fell from before the sun.\n\n39. Skoll is the wolf | that to Ironwood\nFollows the glittering god,\nAnd the son of Hrothvitnir, | Hati, awaits\nThe burning bride of heaven.\n\n40. Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth,\nAnd the ocean out of his blood;\nOf his bones the hills, | of his hair the trees,\nOf his skull the heavens high.\n\n[which the gods had made to light the world from the sparks which flew out of Muspellsheim. The horses were called Alsvith and Arvak, and under their yokes the gods set two bellows to cool them, and in some songs these are called 'the cold iron.'\"\n\n38. ~<Svalin~> (\"The Cooling\"): the only other reference to this shield is in ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 15.\n\n39. ~<Skoll~> and ~<Hati~>: the wolves that devour respectively the sun and moon. The latter is the son of Hrothvitnir (\"The Mighty Wolf,\" i. e. Fenrir); cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 40, and ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 46-47, in which Fenrir appears as the thief. ~<Ironwood~>: a conjectural emendation of an obscure phrase; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 40.\n\n40. This and the following stanza are quoted by Snorri. They seem to have come from a different source from the others of this poem; Edzardi suggests an older version of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. This stanza is closely parallel to ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 21, which see, as also ~<Voluspo~>, 3. Snorri, following this account, has a few details to add. The stones were made out of Ymir's teeth and such of his bones as were broken. Mithgarth was a mountain-wall made out of Ymir's eyebrows, and set around the earth because of the enmity of the giants.]",
					
					"41. Mithgarth the gods | from his eyebrows made,\nAnd set for the sons of men;\nAnd out of his brain | the baleful clouds\nThey made to move on high.\n\n42. His the favor of Ull | and of all the gods\nWho first in the flames will reach;\nFor the house can be seen | by the sons of the gods\nIf the kettle aside were cast.\n\n43. In days of old | did Ivaldi's sons\nSkithblathnir fashion fair,\n\The best of ships | for the bright god Freyr,\nThe noble son of Njorth.\n\n[42. With this stanza Othin gets back to his immediate situation, bound as he is between two fires. He calls down a blessing on the man who will reach into the fire and pull aside the great kettle which, in Icelandic houses, hung directly under the smoke vent in the roof, and thus kept any one above from looking down into the interior. On ~<Ull~>, the archer-god, cf. stanza 5 and note. He is specified here apparently for no better reason than that his name fits the initial-rhyme.\n\n43. This and the following stanza are certainly interpolated, for they have nothing to do with the context, and stanza 45 continues the dramatic conclusion of the poem begun in stanza 42. This stanza is quoted by Snorri. ~<Ivaldi~> (\"The Mighty\"): he is known only as the father of the craftsmen-dwarfs who made not only the ship Skithblathnir, but also Othin's spear Gungnir, and the golden hair for Thor's wife, Sif, after Loki had maliciously cut her own hair off. ~<Skithblathnir~>: this ship (\"Wooden-Bladed\") always had a fair wind, whenever the sail was set; it could be folded up at will and put in the pocket. ~<Freyr~>: concerning him and his father, see Voluspo, 21, note, and ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note.]",
					
					"44. The best of trees | must Yggdrasil be,\nSkithblathnir best of boats;\nOf all the gods | is Othin the greatest,\nAnd Sleipnir the best of steeds;\nBifrost of bridges, | Bragi of skalds,\nHobrok of hawks, | and Garm of hounds.\n\n45. To the race of the gods | my face have I raised,\nAnd the wished-for aid have I waked;\nFor to all the gods | has the message gone\nThat sit in Ãgir's seats,\nThat drink within Ãgir's doors.\n\n[44. Snorri quotes this stanza. Like stanza 43 an almost certain interpolation, it was probably drawn in by the reference to Skithblathnir in the stanza interpolated earlier. It is presumably in faulty condition. One Ms. has after the fifth line half of a sixth,--\"Brimir of swords.\" ~<Yggdrasil~>: cf. stanzas 25-35. ~<Skithblathnir~>: cf. stanza 43, note. ~<Sleipnir~>: Othin's eight-legged horse, one of Loki's numerous progeny, borne by him to the stallion Svathilfari. This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari's aid, as to make the gods fear he would win his promised reward--Freyja and the sun and moon. To delay the work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant failed to complete his task within the stipulated time. ~<Bilrost~>: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza), on which cf. stanza 29. ~<Bragi~>: the god of poetry. He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned only three times in the poems of the ~<Edda~>. In Snorri's ~<Edda~>, however, he is of great importance. His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth. Perhaps the Norwegian skald Bragi Boddason, the oldest recorded skaldic poet, had been traditionally apotheosized as early as the tenth century. ~<Hobrok~>: nothing further is known of him. ~<Garm~>: cf. Voluspo, 44.\n\n45. With this stanza the narrative current of the poem is resumed. Ãgir: the sea-god; cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, introductory prose.]",

Concerning the condition of stanzas 46-50, quoted by Snorri, nothing definite can be said. Lines and entire stanzas of this \"catalogue\" sort undoubtedly came and went with great freedom all through the period of oral transmission. Many of the names are not mentioned elsewhere, and often their significance is sheer guesswork. As in nearly every episode Othin appeared in disguise, the number of his names was necessarily almost limitless. ~<Grim~>: \"The Hooded.\" ~<Gangleri~>: \"The Wanderer.\" ~<Herjan~>: \"The Ruler.\" ~<Hjalmberi~>: \"The Helmet-Bearer.\" ~<Thekk~>: \"The Much-Loved.\" ~<Thrithi~>: \"The Third\" (in Snorri's Edda the stories are all told in the form of answers to questions, the speakers being Har, Jafnhar and Thrithi. Just what this tripartite form of Othin signifies has been the source of endless debate. Probably this line is late enough to betray the somewhat muddled influence of early Christianity.) ~<Thuth~> and ~<Uth~>: both names defy guesswork. ~<Helblindi~>: \"Hel-Blinder\" (two manuscripts have ~<Herblindi~>--\"Host-Blinder\"). ~<Hor~>: \"The High One.\"\n\n47. ~<Sath~>: \"The Truthful.\" ~<Svipal~>: \"The Changing.\" ~<Sanngetal~>: \"The Truth-Teller.\" ~<Herteit~>: \"Glad of the Host.\" ~<Hnikar~>: \"The Overthrower.\" ~<Bileyg~>: \"The Shifty-Eyed.\" ~<Baleyg~>: \"The Flaming-Eyed.\" ~<Bolverk~>: \"Doer of Ill\" (cf. Hovamol, 104 and note). ~<Fjolnir~>: \"The Many-Shaped.\" ~<Grimnir~>: \"The Hooded.\" ~<Glapswith~>: \"Swift in Deceit.\" ~<Fjolsvith~>: \"Wide of Wisdom.\"\n\n48. ~<Sithhott~>: \"With Broad Hat.\" ~<Sithskegg~>: \"Long-Bearded.\"]",

Nothing is known of Asmund, of Othin's appearance as Jalk, or of the occasion when he \"went in a sledge\" as Kjalar (\"Ruler of Keels\"?). ~<Thror~> and ~<Vithur~> are also of uncertain meaning. ~<Oski~>: \"God of Wishes.\" ~<Biflindi~>: the manuscripts vary widely in the form of this name. ~<Jafnhor~>: \"Equally High\" (cf. note on stanza 46). ~<Omi~>: \"The Shouter.\" ~<Gondlir~>: \"Wand Bearer.\" ~<Harbarth~>: \"Graybeard\" (cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, introduction).\n\n50. Nothing further is known of the episode here mentioned Sokkmimir is presumably Mithvitnir's son. Snorri quotes the names Svithur and Svithrir, but omits all the remainder of the stanza.]",

Again the poem returns to the direct action, Othin addressing the terrified GeirrÃ¶th. The manuscripts show no lacuna. Some editors supply a second line from paper manuscripts: \"Greatly by me art beguiled.\"\n\n53. ~<Ygg~>: Othin (\"The Terrible\"). ~<The~> ~<maids~>: the three Norns.\n\n54.

					"King GeirrÃ¶th sat and had his sword on his knee, half drawn from its sheath. But when he heard that Othin was come thither, then he rose up and sought to take Othin from the fire. The sword slipped from his hand, and fell with the hilt down. The king stumbled and fell forward, and the sword pierced him through, and slew him. Then Othin vanished, but Agnar long ruled there as king."

					"~<Skirnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Skirnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Skirnismol~> is found complete in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and through stanza 27 in the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~>. Snorri quotes the concluding stanza. In ~<Regius~> the poem is entitled \"For Scirnis\" (\"Skirnir's journey\").\n\nThe ~<Skirnismol~> differs sharply from the poems preceding it, in that it has a distinctly ballad quality. As a matter of fact, however, its verse is altogether dialogue, the narrative being supplied in the prose \"links,\" concerning which cf. introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>. The dramatic effectiveness and vivid characterization of the poem seem to connect it with the ~<Thrymskvitha~>, and the two may possibly have been put into their present form by the same man. Bugge's guess that the Skirnismol was the work of the author of the ~<Lokasenna~> is also possible, though it has less to support it.\n\nCritics have generally agreed in dating the poem as we now have it as early as the first half of the tenth century; Finnur Jonsson puts it as early as goo, and claims it, as usual, for Norway. Doubtless it was current in Norway, in one form or another, before the first Icelandic settlements, but his argument that the thistle (stanza 31) is not an Icelandic plant has little weight, for such curse-formulas must have traveled freely from place to place. In view of the evidence pointing to a western origin for many or all of the Eddic poems, Jonsson's reiterated \"Digtet er sikkert norsk og ikke islandsk\" is somewhat exasperating. Wherever the ~<Skirnismol~> was composed, it has been preserved in exceptionally good condition, and seems to be practically devoid of interpolations or lacunÃ¦.\n\n__________________\n\nFreyr, the son of Njorth, had sat one day in Hlithskjolf, and looked over all the worlds. He looked into Jotunheim, and saw there a fair maiden, as she went from her father's house to her bower. Forthwith he felt a mighty",
					
					"love-sickness. Skirnir was the name of Freyr's servant; Njorth bade him ask speech of Freyr. He said:\n\n1. \"Go now, Skirnir! | and seek to gain\nSpeech from my son;\nAnd answer to win, | for whom the wise one\nIs mightily moved.\"\n\n~<Skirnir spake:~>\n2. \"Ill words do I now | await from thy son,\nIf I seek to get speech with him,\nAnd answer to win, | for whom the wise one\nIs mightily moved.\"\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Freyr~>: concerning his father, Njorth, and the race of the Wanes in general, cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 21 and note. Snorri thus describes Njorth's family: \"Njorth begat two children in Noatun; the son was named Freyr, and the daughter Freyja; they were fair of aspect and mighty. Freyr is the noblest of the gods; he rules over rain and sunshine, and therewith the fruitfulness of the earth; it is well to call upon him for plenty and welfare, for he rules over wealth for mankind. Freyja is the noblest of the goddesses. When she rides to the fight, she has one-half of the slain, and Othin has half. When she goes on a journey, she drives her two cats, and sits in a cart. Love-songs please her well, and it is good to call on her in love-matters.\" ~<Hlithskjolf~>: Othin's watch-tower; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<He~> ~<said~>: both manuscripts have \"Then Skathi said:\" (Skathi was Njorth's wife), but Bugge's emendation, based on Snorri's version, is doubtless correct.\n\n1. ~<My~> ~<son~>: both manuscripts, and many editors, have \"our son,\" which, of course, goes with the introduction of Skathi in the prose. As the stanza is clearly addressed to Skirnir, the change of pronouns seems justified. The same confusion occurs in stanza 2, where Skirnir in the manuscripts is made to speak of Freyr as]",

Elfbeam: the sun, so called because its rays were fatal to elves and dwarfs; cf. ~<Alvissmol~>, 35.\n\n6. ~<Gymir~>: a mountain-giant, husband of Aurbotha, and father of Gerth, fairest among women. This is all Snorri tells of him in his paraphrase of the story.\n\n7. Snorri's paraphrase of the poem is sufficiently close so that his addition of another sentence to Freyr's speech makes it probable]",

This has been tentatively reconstructed, thus: \"Hither to me shalt thou bring the maid, / And home shalt thou lead her here, / If her father wills it or wills it not, / And good reward shalt thou get.\" Finn Magnusen detected the probable omission of a stanza here as early as 1821.\n\n8. ~<The~> ~<sword~>: Freyr's gift of his sword to Skirnir eventually proves fatal, for at the last battle, when Freyr is attacked by Beli, whom he kills bare-handed, and later when the fire-demon, Surt, slays him in turn, he is weaponless; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 53 and note. ~<Against~> ~<the~> ~<giants~> ~<grim~>: the condition of this line makes it seem like an error in copying, and it is possible that it should be identical with the fourth line of the next stanza.]",

There were fierce dogs bound before the gate of the fence which was around Gerth's hall.

Jonsson marks this stanza as interpolated. The word translated ~<most~> ~<evil~> is another case of guesswork.\n\n34. Most editors reject line 3 as spurious, and some also reject line 6.

					"~<Harbarthsljoth~>\n\n~<The Poem of Harbarth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Harbarthsljoth is found complete in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, where it follows the ~<Skirnismol~>, and from the fourth line of stan{z}a 19 to the end of the poem in the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~>, of which it occupies the first page and a half.\n\nThe poem differs sharply from those which precede it in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, both in metrical form and in spirit. It is, indeed, the most nearly formless of all the Eddic poems. The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. Introduction, where an example is given). The name of this verse-form means \"in the manner of conversation,\" and the Harbarthsljoth's verse fully justifies the term. The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of Malahattr, but in the Harbarthsljoth the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently employed. A few of the speeches of which the poem is composed cannot be twisted into any known Old Norse metre, and appear to be simply prose.\n\nHow far this confusion is due to interpolations and faulty transmission of the original poem is uncertain. Finnur Jonsson has attempted a wholesale purification of the poem, but his arbitrary condemnation of words, lines, and entire stanzas as spurious is quite unjustified by any positive evidence. I have accepted Mogk's theory that the author was \"a first-rate psychologist, but a poor poet,\" and have translated the poem as it stands in the manuscripts. I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original Norse.\n\nThe poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise of the ferryman Harbarth. Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic. It consists mainly of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the life of one or the other of the disputants. Some editors have sought to read a complex symbolism into it, particularly by representing",
					
					"it as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor). But it seems a pity to take such a vigorous piece of broad farce too seriously.\n\nVerse-form, substance, and certain linguistic peculiarities, notably the suffixed articles, point to a relatively late date (eleventh century) for the poem in its present form. Probably it had its origin in the early days, but its colloquial nature and its vulgarity made it readily susceptible to changes.\n\nOwing to the chaotic state of the text, and the fact that none of the editors or commentators have succeeded in improving it much, I have not in this case attempted to give all the important emendations and suggestions. The stanza-divisions are largely arbitrary.\n\n__________________\n\nThor was on his way back from a journey in the East, and came to a sound; on the other side of the sound was a ferryman with a boat. Thor called out:\n\n1. \"Who is the fellow yonder, | on the farther shore of the sound?\"\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Harbarth~> (\"Gray-Beard\"): Othin. On the nature of the prose notes found in the manuscripts, cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introduction. ~<Thor~>: the journeys of the thunder-god were almost as numerous as those of Othin; cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~> and ~<Hymiskvitha~>. Like the Robin Hood of the British ballads, Thor was often temporarily worsted, but always managed to come out ahead in the end. His \"Journey in the East\" is presumably the famous episode, related in full by Snorri, in the course of which he en countered the giant Skrymir, and in the house of Utgartha-Loki lifted the cat which turned out to be Mithgarthsorm. The ~<Hymiskvitha~> relates a further incident of this journey.]",

The superscriptions to the speeches are badly confused in the manuscripts, but editors have agreed fairly well as to where they belong. 3. From the fact that in ~<Regius~> line 3 begins with a capital letter, it is possible that lines 3-4 constitute the ferryman's reply, with something lost before stanza 4.\n\n4. ~<Thy~> ~<mother~>: Jorth (Earth).\n\n5.

After rescuing his father, Magni said to him: \"There would have been little trouble, father, had I but come sooner; I think I should have sent this giant to hell with my fist if I had met him first.\" Magni and his brother, Mothi, inherit Thor's hammer.\n\n12. This stanza is hopelessly confused as to form, but none of the editorial rearrangements have materially altered the meaning. ~<Doomed~> ~<to~> ~<die~>: the word \"feigr\" occurs constantly in the Old Norse poems and sagas; the idea of an inevitable but unknown fate seems to have been practically universal through out the pre-Christian period. On the concealment of names from enemies, cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, prose after stanza 1.]",

This stanza, like the preceding one, is peculiarly chaotic in the manuscript, and has been variously emended.\n\n14. ~<Hrungnir~>: this giant rashly wagered his head that his horse, Gullfaxi, was swifter than Othin's Sleipnir. In the race, which Hrungnir lost, he managed to dash uninvited into the home of the gods, where he became very drunk. Thor ejected him, and accepted his challenge to a duel. Hrungnir, terrified, had a helper made for him in the form of a dummy giant nine miles high and three miles broad. Hrungnir himself had a three-horned heart of stone and a head of stone; his shield was of stone and his weapon was a grindstone. But Thjalfi, Thor's servant, told him the god would attack him out of the ground, wherefore Hrungnir laid down his shield and stood on it. The hammer Mjollnir shattered both the grindstone and Hrungnir's]",

Thor is always eager for stories of this sort; cf. stanzas 31 and 33.\n\n19. Lines 1-2 are obscure, but apparently Harbarth means that the women were wise to give in to him cheerfully, resistance to his power being as impossible as (lines 3-4) making ropes of sand or digging the bottoms out of the valleys. Nothing further is known of these unlucky \"seven sisters.\"]",

Loki, through whose fault she had been betrayed, was sent after her by the gods. He went in Freyja's \"hawk's-dress\" (cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 3), turned Ithun into a nut, and flew back with her. Thjazi, in the shape of an eagle, gave chase. But the gods kindled a fire which burnt the eagle's wings, and then they killed him. Snorri's prose version does not attribute this feat particularly to Thor. Thjazi's daughter was Skathi, whom the gods permitted to marry Njorth as a recompense for her father's death. ~<Alvaldi~>: of him we know only that he was the father of Thjazi, Ithi and Gang, who divided his wealth, each taking a mouthful of gold. The name is variously spelled. It is not known which stars were called \"Thjazi's Eyes.\" In the middle of line 4 begins the fragmentary version of the poem found in the ArnamagnÃ¦an Codex.\n\n20. ~<Riders~> ~<by~> ~<night~>: witches, who were supposed to ride on wolves in the dark. Nothing further is known of this adventure.]",

Thor killed no women of the giants' race on the \"journey to the East\" so fully described by Snorri, his great giant-killing adventure being the one narrated in the Thrymskvitha.\n\n24. ~<Valland~>: this mythical place (\"Land of Slaughter\") is elsewhere mentioned, but not further characterised; cf. prose introduction to ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~>, and ~<Helreith~> ~<Brynhildar~>, 2.

Nowhere else is it indicated that Thor has an asylum for dead peasants.\n\n26. The reference here is to one of the most familiar episodes in Thor's eastward journey. He and his companions came to a house in the forest, and went in to spend the night. Being disturbed by an earthquake and a terrific noise, they all crawled into a smaller room opening from the main one. In the morning, however, they discovered that the earthquake had been occasioned by the giant Skrymir's lying down near them, and the noise by his snoring. The house in which they had taken refuge was his glove, the smaller room being the thumb. Skrymir was in fact Utgartha-Loki himself. That he is in this stanza called Fjalar (the name occurs also in ~<Hovamol~>, 14) is probably due to a confusion of the names by which Utgartha-Loki went. Loki taunts Thor with this adventure in ~<Lokasenna~>, 60 and 62, line 3 of this stanza being perhaps interpolated from ~<Lokasenna~>, 60, 4.]",

					"~<Hymiskvitha~>\n\n~<The Lay of Hymir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Hymiskvitha~> is found complete in both manuscripts; in ~<Regius~> it follows the ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, while in the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~> it comes after the ~<Grimnismol~>. Snorri does not quote it, although he tells the main story involved.\n\nThe poem is a distinctly inferior piece of work, obviously based on various narrative fragments, awkwardly pieced together. Some critics, Jessen and Edzardi for instance, have maintained that the compiler had before him three distinct poems, which he simply put together; others, like Finnur Jonsson and Mogk, think that the author made a new poem of his own on the basis of earlier poems, now lost. It seems probable that he took a lot of odds and ends of material concerning Thor, whether in prose or in verse, and worked them together in a perfunctory way, without much caring how well they fitted. His chief aim was probably to impress the credulous imaginations of hearers greedy for wonders.\n\nThe poem is almost certainly one of the latest of those dealing with the gods, though Finnur Jonsson, in order to support his theory of a Norwegian origin, has to date it relatively early. If, as seems probable, it was produced in Iceland, the chances are that it was composed in the first half of the eleventh century. Jessen, rather recklessly, goes so far as to put it two hundred years later. In any case, it belongs to a period of literary decadence,--the great days of Eddic poetry would never have permitted the nine hundred headed person found in Hymir's home-- and to one in which the usual forms of diction in mythological poetry had yielded somewhat to the verbal subtleties of skaldic verse.\n\nWhile the skaldic poetry properly falls outside the limits of this book, it is necessary here to say a word about it. There is preserved, in the sagas and elsewhere, a very considerable body of lyric poetry, the authorship of each poem being nearly always definitely stated, whether correctly or otherwise. This type of poetry is marked by an extraordinary complexity of diction, with a peculiarly difficult vocabulary of its own. It was to explain some of the \"kennings\" which composed this special",
					
					"vocabulary that Snorri wrote one of the sections of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. As an illustration, in a single stanza of one poem in the ~<Egilssaga~>, a sword is called \"the halo of the helm,\" \"the wound-hoe,\" \"the blood-snake\" (possibly; no one is sure what the compound word means) and \"the ice of the girdle,\" while men appear in the same stanza as \"Othin's ash-trees,\" and battle is spoken of as \"the iron game.\" One of the eight lines has defied translation completely.\n\nSkaldic diction made relatively few inroads into the earlier Eddic poems, but in the ~<Hymiskvitha~> these circumlocutions are fairly numerous. This sets the poem somewhat apart from the rest of the mythological collection. Only the vigor of the two main stories--Thor's expedition after Hymir's kettle and the fishing trip in which he caught Mithgarthsorm--saves it from complete mediocrity.\n\n1. Of old the gods | made feast together,\nAnd drink they sought | ere sated they were;\nTwigs they shook, | and blood they tried:\nRich fare in Ãgir's | hall they found.\n\n[1. ~<Twigs~>: Vigfusson comments at some length on \"the rite practised in the heathen age of inquiring into the future by dipping bunches of chips or twigs into the blood (of sacrifices) and shaking them.\" But the two operations may have been separate, the twigs being simply \"divining-rods\" marked with runes. In either case, the gods were seeking information by magic as to where they could find plenty to drink. ~<Ãgir~>: a giant who is also the god of the sea; little is known of him outside of what is told here and in the introductory prose to the ~<Lokasenna~>, though Snorri has a brief account of him, giving his home as Hlesey (LÃ¤sÃ¶, cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 37). ~<Grimnismol~>, 45, has a reference to this same feast.]",
					
					"2. The mountain-dweller | sat merry as boyhood,\nBut soon like a blinded | man he seemed;\nThe son of Ygg | gazed in his eyes:\n\"For the gods a feast | shalt thou forthwith get.\"\n\n3. The word-wielder toil | for the giant worked,\nAnd so revenge | on the gods he sought;\nHe bade Sif's mate | the kettle bring:\n\"Therein for ye all | much ale shall I brew.\"\n\n4. The far-famed ones | could find it not,\nAnd the holy gods | could get it nowhere;\nTill in truthful wise | did Tyr speak forth,\nAnd helpful counsel | to Hlorrithi gave.\n\n5. \"There dwells to the east | of Elivagar\nHymir the wise | at the end of heaven;\nA kettle my father | fierce doth own,\nA mighty vessel | a mile in depth.\"\n\n[2. ~<Mountain-dweller~>: the giant (Ãgir). ~<Line 2~>: the principal word in the original has defied interpretation, and any translation of the line must be largely guesswork. ~<Ygg~>: Othin; his son is Thor. Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.\n\n3. ~<Word-wielder~>: Thor. ~<The giant~>: Ãgir. ~<Sif~>: Thor's wife; cf. Harbarthsljoth, 48. ~<The~> ~<kettle~>: Ãgir's kettle is possibly the sea itself.\n\n4. ~<Tyr~>: the god of battle; his two great achievements were thrusting his hand into the mouth of the wolf Fenrir so that the gods might bind him, whereby he lost his hand (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 39, note), and his fight with the hound Garm in the last battle, in which they kill each other. ~<Hlorrithi~>: Thor.\n\n5. ~<Elivagar~> (\"Stormy Waves\"): possibly the Milky Way;]",
					
					"~<Thor spake:~>\n6. \"May we win, dost thou think, | this whirler of water?\"\n\n~<Tyr spake:~>\n\"Aye, friend, we can, | if cunning we are.\"\n\n7. Forward that day | with speed they fared,\nFrom Asgarth came they | to Egil's home;\nThe goats with horns | bedecked he guarded;\nThen they sped to the hall | where Hymir dwelt.\n\n8. The youth found his grandam, | that greatly he loathed,\n\n[cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 31, note. ~<Hymir~>: this giant figures only in this episode. It is not clear why Tyr, who is elsewhere spoken of as a son of Othin, should here call Hymir his father. Finnur Jonsson, in an attempt to get round this difficulty, deliberately changed the word \"father\" to \"grandfather,\" but this does not help greatly.\n\n6. Neither manuscript has any superscriptions, but most editors have supplied them as above. From this point through stanza it the editors have varied considerably in grouping the lines into stanzas. The manuscripts indicate the third lines of stanzas 7, 8, 9, and to as beginning stanzas, but this makes more complications than the present arrangement. It is possible that, as Sijmons suggests, two lines have been lost after stanza 6.\n\n7. ~<Egil~>: possibly, though by no means certainly, the father of Thor's servant, Thjalfi, for, according to Snorri, Thor's first stop on this journey was at the house of a peasant whose children, Thjalfi and Roskva, he took into his service; cf. stanza 38, note. The ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~> has \"Ãgir\" instead of \"Egil,\" but, aside from the fact that Thor had just left Ãgir's house, the sea-god can hardly have been spoken of as a goat-herd.\n\n8. ~<The~> ~<youth~>: Tyr, whose extraordinary grandmother is Hymir's mother. We know nothing further of her, or of the other,]",
					
					"And full nine hundred | heads she had;\nBut the other fair | with gold came forth,\nAnd the bright-browed one | brought beer to her son.\n\n9. \"Kinsman of giants, | beneath the kettle\nWill I set ye both, | ye heroes bold;\nFor many a time | my dear-loved mate\nTo guests is wrathful | and grim of mind.\"\n\n10. Late to his home | the misshapen Hymir,\nThe giant harsh, | from his hunting came;\nThe icicles rattled | as in he came,\nFor the fellow's chin-forest | frozen was.\n\n11. \"Hail to thee, Hymir! | good thoughts mayst thou have;\nHere has thy son | to thine hall now come;\n(For him have we waited, | his way was long;)\nAnd with him fares | the foeman of Hroth,\nThe friend of mankind, | and Veur they call him.\n\n[who is Hymir's wife and Tyr's mother. It may be guessed, however, that she belonged rather to the race of the gods than to that of the giants.\n\n11. Two or three editors give this stanza a superscription (\"The concubine spake\", \"The daughter spake\"). Line 3 is commonly regarded as spurious. ~<The~> ~<foeman~> ~<of~> ~<Hroth~>: of course this means Thor, but nothing is known of any enemy of his by this name. Several editors have sought to make a single word meaning \"the famous enemy\" out of the phrase. Concerning Thor as the friend of man, particularly of the peasant class, cf. introduction to Harbarthsljoth. ~<Veur~>: another name, of uncertain meaning, for Thor.]",
					
					"12. \"See where under | the gable they sit!\nBehind the beam | do they hide themselves.\"\nThe beam at the glance | of the giant broke,\nAnd the mighty pillar | in pieces fell.\n\n13. Eight fell from the ledge, | and one alone,\nThe hard-hammered kettle, | of all was whole;\nForth came they then, | and his foes he sought,\nThe giant old, | and held with his eyes.\n\n14. Much sorrow his heart | foretold when he saw\nThe giantess' foeman | come forth on the floor;\nThen of the steers | did they bring in three;\nTheir flesh to boil | did the giant bid.\n\n15. By a head was each | the shorter hewed,\nAnd the beasts to the fire | straight they bore;\nThe husband of Sif, | ere to sleep he went,\nAlone two oxen | of Hymir's ate.\n\n16. To the comrade hoary | of Hrungnir then\nDid Hlorrithi's meal | full mighty seem;\n\"Next time at eve | we three must eat\nThe food we have | {illegible}s the hunting's spoil.\"\n\n[13. ~<Eight~>: the giant's glance, besides breaking the beam, knocks down all the kettles with such violence that all but the one under which Thor and Tyr are hiding are broken.\n\n14. Hymir's wrath does not permit him to ignore the duties of a host to his guests, always strongly insisted on.\n\n15. Thor's appetite figures elsewhere; cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 24.\n\n16. ~<The~> ~<comrade~> ~<of~> ~<Hrungnir~>: Hymir, presumably simply because both are giants; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 14 and note.]",

The manuscripts indicate no lacuna, and many editors unite stanza 17 with lines 1 and 2 of 18. Sijmons and Gering assume a gap after these two lines, but it seems more probable that the missing passage, if any, belonged before them, supplying the connection with the previous stanza.\n\n18. The manuscripts have no superscription. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with lines 1 and 2 of stanza 19. In Snorri's extended paraphrase of the story, Hymir declines to go fishing with Thor on the ground that the latter is too small a person to be worth bothering about. \"You would freeze,\" he says, \"if you stayed out in mid-ocean as long as I generally do.\" ~<Bait~> (line 4): the word literally means \"chaff,\" hence any small bits; Hymir means that Thor should collect dung for bait.\n\n19. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with stanza 20. ~<Fortress~>, etc.: the ox's head; cf. introductory note concerning the diction of this poem. Several editors assume a lacuna after stanza 19, but this seems unnecessary.]",

The warder of men, | the worm's destroyer,\nFixed on his hook | the head of the ox;\nThere gaped at the bait | the foe of the gods,\nThe girdler of all | the earth beneath.\n\n[20. The manuscripts have no superscription. ~<Steerer~> ~<of~> ~<ships~>: probably merely a reference to Thor's intention to go fishing. The lacuna after stanza 20 is assumed by most editors.\n\n21. ~<Lord~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<goats~>: Thor, because of his goat-drawn chariot. ~<Ape-begotten~>: Hymir; the word \"api,\" rare until relatively late times in its literal sense, is fairly common with the meaning of \"fool.\" Giants were generally assumed to be stupid. ~<Steed~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<rollers~>: a ship, because boats were pulled up on shore by means of rollers.\n\n23. ~<Warder~> ~<of~> ~<men~>: Thor; cf. stanza 11. ~<Worm's~> ~<destroyer~>: likewise Thor, who in the last battle slays, and is slain by, Mithgarthsorm; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 56. ~<The~> ~<foe~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<gods~>: Mithgarthsorm, who lies in the sea, and surrounds the whole earth.]",
					
					"24. The venomous serpent | swiftly up\nTo the boat did Thor, | the bold one, pull;\nWith his hammer the loathly | hill of the hair\nOf the brother of Fenrir | he smote from above.\n\n25.

No gap is indicated in the manuscripts, but that a line or more has been lost is highly probable. In Snorri's version, Thor pulls so hard on the line that he drives both his feet through the flooring of the boat, and stands on bottom. When he pulls the serpent up, Hymir cuts the line with his bait-knife, which explains the serpent's escape. Thor, in a rage, knocks Hymir overboard with his hammer, and then wades ashore. The lines of stanzas 25 and 26 have been variously grouped.\n\n26. No gap is indicated in the manuscripts, but line 2 begins with a small letter. ~<A~> ~<second~> ~<wind~>: another direction, i. e., he put about for the shore.]",

In its place Bugge supplies a line--\"These words spake Hymir, | the giant wise.\" The manuscripts reverse the order of lines 2 and 3, and in both of them line 4 stands after stanza 28. ~<Goat~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<flood~>: boat.\n\n28. ~<Sea-horse~>: boat. ~<Surf-swine~>: the whales.\n\n29. Snorri says nothing of this episode of Hymir's cup. The glass which cannot be broken appears in the folklore of various races.\n\n31. ~<The~> ~<loved~> ~<one~>: Hymir's wife and Tyr's mother; cf. stanza 8 and note. The idea that a giant's skull is harder than stone or anything else is characteristic of the later Norse folk-stories, and]",

The manuscripts have no superscription. Line 4 in the manuscripts is somewhat obscure, and Bugge, followed by some editors, suggests a reading which may be rendered (beginning with the second half of line 3): \"No more can I speak / Ever again | as I spoke of old.\"\n\n35, ~<The~> ~<father~> ~<of~> ~<Mothi~> ~<and~> ~<Sif's~> ~<husband~>: Thor.]",

Hymir's mother is, however, the only many-headed giant actually to appear in the action of the poems, and it is safe to assume that the tradition as a whole belongs to the period of Norse folk-tales of the ~<mÃ¤rchen~> order.\n\n37. No gap is indicated in the manuscripts. Some editors put the missing line as 2, some as 3, and some, leaving the present three lines together, add a fourth, and metrically incorrect, one from late paper manuscripts: \"Who with Hymir followed after.\" ~<Whales~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<waste~>: giants.\n\n38. According to Snorri, when Thor set out with Loki (not Tyr) for the giants' land, he stopped first at a peasant's house (cf. stanza 7 and note). There he proceeded to cook his own goats for supper. The peasant's son, Thjalfi, eager to get at the marrow, split one of the leg-bones with his knife. The next morning, when Thor was ready to proceed with his journey, he called the goats to life again, but one of them proved irretrievably lame. His wrath led the peasant to give him both his children as]",

Snorri does not indicate that Loki was in any way to blame.\n\n39. This deliberate introduction of the story-teller is exceedingly rare in the older poetry.\n\n40. The translation of the last two lines is mostly guess work, as the word rendered \"gods\" is uncertain, and the one rendered \"at the autumn-time\" is quite obscure.]"

					"~<Lokasenna~>\n\n~<Loki's Wrangling~>\n\n~<Introductory Notes~>\n\nThe ~<Lokasenna~> is found only in ~<Regius~>, where it follows the ~<Hymiskvitha~>; Snorri quotes four lines of it, grouped together as a single stanza.\n\nThe poem is one of the most vigorous of the entire collection, and seems to have been preserved in exceptionally good condition. The exchange or contest of insults was dear to the Norse heart, and the ~<Lokasenna~> consists chiefly of Loki's taunt; to the assembled gods and goddesses, and their largely ineffectual attempts to talk back to him. The author was evidently well versed in mythological fore, and the poem is full of references to incidents not elsewhere recorded. As to its date and origin there is the usual dispute, but the latter part of the tenth century and Iceland seem the best guesses.\n\nThe prose notes are long and of unusual interest. The introductory one links the poem closely to the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, much as the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~> and ~<Sigrdrifumol~> are linked together; the others fill in the narrative gaps in the dialogue--very like stage directions,--and provide a conclusion by relating Loki's punishment, which, presumably, is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when the poem was recited during the two centuries or so before it was committed to writing, the speaker inserted some such explanatory comments, and the compiler of the collection followed this example by adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The ~<Lokasenna~> is certainly much older than the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, the connection between them being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century compiler evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose work he was annotating.\n\n__________________\n\nÃgir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif,",
					
					"Thor's wife, was there, and Brag, with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but one hand, was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when they had bound him. There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin. Loki was there, and Freyr's\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Ãgir~>: the sea-god; Snorri gives Hler as another of his names, but he is not elsewhere called Gymir, which is the name of the giant, Gerth's father, in the Skirnismol. On Ãgir cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 45, and ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 1. ~<Frigg~>: though Othin's wife is often mentioned, she plays only a minor part in the Eddic poems; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 34, ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, I, and ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<Thor~>: the compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor's movements; the \"Journey in the East\" here mentioned cannot be the one described in the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor through out that expedition. He probably means no more than that Thor was off killing giants. ~<Sif~>: concerning Thor's wife the chief incident is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at the command of the wrathful Thor, was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new supply of hair out of gold; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 48. ~<Bragi~>: the god of poetry; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 44 and note. ~<Ithun~>: the goddess of youth; cf. note on ~<Skirnismol~>, 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the Eddic poems, but Snorri tells in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her and her apples, explaining the reference in ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 19 (q. v.). ~<Tyr~>: the god of battle; cf. ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 4, and (concerning his dealings with the wolf Fenrir) ~<Voluspo~>, 39, note. ~<Njorth~>: the chief of the Wanes, and father of Freyr and Freyja; cf.

Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir.

There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus swore blood-brotherhood, but they were so often allied in enterprises that the idea is wholly reasonable. The common process of \"mingling blood\" was carried out quite literally, and the promise of -which Loki speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied the ceremony; cf.

					"~<Thrymskvitha~>\n\n~<The~> ~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Thrym~>\n\n~<Introductory~> ~<Note~>\n\nThe ~<Thrymskvitha~> is found only in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, where it follows the ~<Lokasenna~>. Snorri does not quote from it, nor, rather oddly, does the story occur in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>.\n\nArtistically the ~<Thrymskvitha~> is one of the best, as it is, next to the ~<Voluspo~>, the most famous, of the entire collection. It has, indeed, been called \"the finest ballad in the world,\" and not without some reason. Its swift, vigorous action, the sharpness of its characterization and the humor of the central situation combine to make it one of the most vivid short narrative poems ever composed. Of course we know nothing specific of its author, but there can be no question that he was a poet of extraordinary ability. The poem assumed its present form, most critics agree, somewhere about 900, and thus it is one of the oldest in the collection. It has been suggested, on the basis of stylistic similarity, that its author may also have composed the ~<Skirnismol~>, and possibly ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~>. There is also some resemblance between the ~<Thrymskvitha~> and the ~<Lokasenna~> (note, in this connection, Bugge's suggestion that the ~<Skirnismol~> and the ~<Lokasenna~> may have been by the same man), and it is not impossible that all four poems have a single authorship.\n\nThe ~<Thrymskvitha~> has been preserved in excellent condition, without any serious gaps or interpolations. In striking contrast to many of the poems, it contains no prose narrative links, the story being told in narrative verse--a rare phenomenon in the poems of the ~<Edda~>.\n\n1.

				Text = {
					"~<Alvissmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Alvis~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nNo better summary of the Alvissmol can be given than Gering's statement that \"it is a versified chapter from the skaldic Poetics.\" The narrative skeleton, contained solely in stanzas 1-8 and in 35, is of the slightest; the dwarf Alvis, desirous of marrying Thor's daughter, is compelled by the god to answer a number of questions to test his knowledge. That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called \"in each of all the worlds,\" but there is no apparent significance in the fact that the gods call the earth one thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions, or \"kennings.\" Concerning the use of these \"kennings\" in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory note to the ~<Hymiskvitha~>.\n\nMogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning it to the period of \"the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.\" It appears to have been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,--Thor's questions, for instance, are neatly balanced in pairs,--and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction, but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous poetry. Finnur Jonsson's attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence, which is by no means incompatible with Mogk's theory (cf. introductory note to the ~<Rigsthula~>).\n\nThe poem is found only in ~<Regius~>, where it follows the Thrymskvitha. Snorri quotes stanzas 2c, and 30, the manuscripts of the ~<Prose Edda~> giving the name of the poem as ~<Alvissmol~>, ~<Alsvinnsmol~> or ~<Olvismol~>. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission, although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily as to defy detection.\n\nThe translation of the many synonyms presents, of course,",
					
					"unusual difficulties, particularly as many of the Norse words can be properly rendered in English only by more or less extended phrases. I have kept to the original meanings as closely as I could without utterly destroying the metrical structure.\n\n~<Alvis spake:~>\n1. \"Now shall the bride | my benches adorn,\nAnd homeward haste forthwith;\nEager for wedlock | to all shall I seem,\nNor at home shall they rob me of rest.\"\n\n~<Thor spake:~>\n2. \"What, pray, art thou? | Why so pale round the nose?\nBy the dead hast thou lain of late?\nTo a giant like | dost thou look, methinks;\nThou wast not born for the bride.\"\n\n~<Alvis spake:~>\n3. \"Alvis am I, | and under the earth\nMy home 'neath the rocks I have;\n\n[1. ~<Alvis~> (\"All-Knowing\"): a dwarf, not elsewhere mentioned. The manuscript nowhere indicates the speakers' name. The bride in question is Thor's daughter; Thruth (\"Might\") is the only daughter of his whose name is recorded, and she does not appear elsewhere in the poems. Her mother was Sif, Thor's wife, whereas the god's sons were born of a giantess. ~<Benches~>: cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, 15 and note.\n\n2. The dwarfs, living beyond the reach of the sun, which was fatal to them (cf. stanzas 16 and 35), were necessarily pale.

Apparently the gods promised Thor's daughter in marriage to Alvis during her father's absence, perhaps as a reward for some craftsmanship of his (cf. Bugge's suggestion as to stanza 3). The text of line 4 is most uncertain.\n\n5. ~<Hero~>: ironically spoken; Alvis takes Thor for a tramp, the god's uncouth appearance often leading to such mistakes; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 6. Line 4 is a trifle uncertain; some editors alter the wording to read \"What worthless woman bore thee?\"\n\n6. ~<Vingthor~> (\"Thor the Hurler\"): cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 1. ~<Sithgrani~> (\"Long-Beard\"): Othin.]",

The dwellers \"in hell\" appear in six stanzas; the phrase probably refers to the world of the dead, though Mogk thinks it may mean the dwarfs. In stanzas where the gods are already listed appear names else where applied only to them,--\"holy ones,\" \"sons of the gods\" and \"high ones,\"--as if these names meant beings of a separate race. \"Men\" appears twice in the same stanza, and so do the giants, if one assumes that they are \"the sons of Suttung.\" Altogether it is useless to pay much attention to the mythology of Alvis's replies.\n\n11. Lines I, 2, and 4 of Thor's questions are regularly abbreviated in the manuscript. ~<Beheld~>, etc.: the word in the manuscript is almost certainly an error, and all kinds of guesses have been made to rectify it.

					"~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> - ~<Baldr's~> ~<Dreams~>\n\n~<Introductory~> ~<Note~>\n\n~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> is found only in the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~>, where it follows the ~<Harbarthsljoth~> fragment. It is preserved in various late paper manuscripts, with the title ~<Vegtamskvitha~> (The Lay of Vegtam), which has been used by some editors.\n\nThe poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been preserved in excellent condition. Its subject-matter and style link it closely with the Voluspo. Four of the five lines of stanza 11 appear, almost without change, in the ~<Voluspo~>, 32-33, and the entire poem is simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those and the preceding stanzas. It has been suggested that ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> and the Voluspo may have been by the same author. There is also enough similarity in style between ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> and the ~<Thrymskvitha~> (note especially the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson's guess that these two poems had a common authorship. In any case, ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> presumably assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth century.\n\nWhether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker in the ~<Voluspo~> is purely a matter for conjecture. Nothing definitely opposes such a supposition. As in the longer poem she foretells the fall of the gods, so in this case she prophesies the first incident of that fall, the death of Baldr. Here she is called up from the dead by Othin, anxious to know the meaning of Baldr's evil dreams; in the ~<Voluspo~> it is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.\n\nThe poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially dramatic rather than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless familiar to every one who heard the poem recited.\n__________________\n\n1.

The manuscript marks the third line as the beginning of a stanza; something may have been lost. Lines 3.4 are thoroughly obscure. According to Bugge the maidens who are to weep for Baldr are the daughters of the sea-god Ãgir, the waves, whose grief will be so tempestuous that they will toss the ships up to the very sky. \"Yards of the sails\" is a doubtfully accurate rendering; the two words, at any rate in later Norse nautical speech, meant respectively the \"tack\" and the \"sheet\" of the square sail.\n\n13.

					"~<Rigsthula~>\n\n~<The Song of Rig~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Rigsthula~> is found in neither of the principal codices. The only manuscript containing it is the so-called ~<Codex~> ~<Wormanius~>, a manuscript of Snorri's ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. The poem appears on the last sheet of this manuscript, which unluckily is incomplete, and thus the end of the poem is lacking. In the ~<Codex~> ~<Wormanius~> itself the poem has no title, but a fragmentary parchment included with it calls the poem the ~<Rigsthula~>. Some late paper manuscripts give it the title of ~<Rigsmol~>.\n\nThe ~<Rigsthula~> is essentially unlike anything else which editors have agreed to include in the so-called ~<Edda~>. It is a definitely cultural poem, explaining, on a mythological basis, the origin of the different castes of early society: the thralls, the peasants, and the warriors. From the warriors, finally, springs one who is destined to become a king, and thus the whole poem is a song in praise of the royal estate. This fact in itself would suffice to indicate that the ~<Rigsthula~> was not composed in Iceland, where for centuries kings were regarded with profound disapproval.\n\nNot only does the ~<Rigsthula~> praise royalty, but it has many of the earmarks of a poem composed in praise of a particular king. The manuscript breaks off at a most exasperating point, just as the connection between the mythical \"Young Kon\" (Konr ungr, konungr, \"king\"; but cf. stanza 44, note) and the monarch in question is about to be established. Owing to the character of the Norse settlements in Iceland, Ireland, and the western islands generally, search for a specific king leads back to either Norway or Denmark; despite the arguments advanced by Edzardi, Vigfusson, Powell, and others, it seems most improbable that such a poem should have been produced elsewhere than on the Continent, the region where Scandinavian royalty most flourished. Finnur Jonsson's claim for Norway, with Harald the Fair-Haired as the probable king in question, is much less impressive than Mogk's ingenious demonstration that the poem was in all probability composed in Denmark, in honor of either Gorm the Old or Harald Blue-Tooth. His proof is based chiefly on the evidence provided by stanza 49, and is summarized in the note to that stanza.",
					
					"The poet, however, was certainly not a Dane, but probably a wandering Norse singer, who may have had a dozen homes, and who clearly had spent much time in some part of the western island world chiefly inhabited by Celts. The extent of Celtic influence on the Eddic poems in general is a matter of sharp dispute. Powell, for example, claims almost all the poems for the \"Western Isles,\" and attributes nearly all their good qualities to Celtic influence. Without here attempting to enter into the details of the argument, it may be said that the weight of authoritative opinion, while clearly recognizing the marks of Celtic influence in the poems, is against this view; contact between the roving Norsemen of Norway and Iceland and the Celts of Ireland and the \"Western Isles,\" and particularly the Orkneys, was so extensive as to make the presumption of an actual Celtic home for the poems seem quite unnecessary.\n\nIn the case of the ~<Rigsthula~> the poet unquestionably had not only picked up bits of the Celtic speech (the name Rig itself is almost certainly of Celtic origin, and there are various other Celtic words employed), but also had caught something of the Celtic literary spirit. This explains the cultural nature of the poem, quite foreign to Norse poetry in general. On the other hand, the style as a whole is vigorously Norse, and thus the explanation that the poem was composed by an itinerant Norse poet who had lived for some time in the Celtic islands, and who was on a visit to the court of a Danish king, fits the ascertainable facts exceedingly well. As Christianity was introduced into Denmark around 960, the ~<Rigsthula~> is not likely to have been composed much after that date, and probably belongs to the first half of the tenth century. Gorm the Old died about the year 935, and was succeeded by Harald Blue-Tooth, who died about 985.\n\nThe fourteenth (or late thirteenth) century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, but there is nothing in the poem itself, and very little anywhere else, to warrant this, and it seems likely that the poet had Othin, and not Heimdall, in mind, his purpose being to trace the origin of the royal estate to the chief of the gods. The evidence bearing on this identification is briefly summed up in the note on the introductory prose passage, but the question involves complex and baffling problems in mythology, and from very early times the status of Heimdall was unquestionably confusing to the Norse mind.",
					
					"They tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall, went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where he called himself Rig. According to these stories is the following poem:\n\n1. Men say there went | by ways so green\nOf old the god, | the aged and wise,\nMighty and strong | did Rig go striding.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n[~<Prose~>. It would be interesting to know how much the annotator meant by the phrase ~<old~> ~<stories~>. Was he familiar with the tradition in forms other than that of the poem? If so, his introductory note was scanty, for, outside of identifying ~<Rig~> as ~<Heimdall~>, he provides no information not found in the poem. Probably he meant simply to refer to the poem itself as a relic of antiquity, and the identification of Rig as Heimdall may well have been an attempt at constructive criticism of his own. The note was presumably written somewhere about 1300, or even later, and there is no reason for crediting the annotator with any considerable knowledge of mythology. There is little to favor the identification of Rig with Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, beyond a few rather vague passages in the other poems. Thus in ~<Voluspo~>, I, the Volva asks hearing \"from Heimdall's sons both high and low\"; in ~<Grimnismol~>, 13, there is a very doubtful line which may mean that Heimdall \"o'er men holds sway, it is said,\" and in \"the Short Voluspo\" (~<Hyndluljoth~>, 40) he is called \"the kinsman of men.\" On the other hand, everything in the ~<Rigsthula~>, including the phrase \"the aged and wise\" in stanza I, and the references to runes in stanzas 36, 44, and 46, fits Othin exceedingly well. It seems probable that the annotator was wrong, and that Rig is Othin, and not Heimdall. ~<Rig~>: almost certainly based on the Old Irish word for \"king,\" \"ri\" or \"rig.\"\n\n1. No gap is indicated, but editors have generally assumed one. Some editors, however, add line 1 of stanza 2 to stanza 1.]",

The manuscript of lines 1-3 is obviously defective, as there are too many words for two lines, and not enough for the full three. The meaning, however, is clearly very much as indicated in the translation. Gering's emendation, which I have followed, consists simply in shifting \"set before them\" from the first line to the second--where the manuscript has no verb,--and supplying the verb \"brought\" in line 1. The various editions contain all sorts of suggestions.\n\n32. The manuscript begins both line 1 and line 2 with a capital]",

Yet many editors, relying on the manuscript punctuation, make 37 and 38 into a single stanza.\n\n39.

This fragment is not indicated as a separate stanza in the manuscript. Perhaps half a line has disappeared, or, as seems more likely, the gap includes two lines and a half.

He married the daughter of a certain Danp, lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.\" This may or may not be conclusive, and it is a great pity that the manuscript breaks off abruptly at this stanza.]"

					"~<Hyndluljoth~>\n\n~<The Poem of Hyndla~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Hyndluljoth is found in neither of the great manuscripts of the Poetic Edda, but is included in the so-called ~<Flateyjarbok~> (Book of the Flat Island), an enormous compilation made some where about 1400. The lateness of this manuscript would of itself be enough to cast a doubt upon the condition in which the poem has been preserved, and there can be no question that what we have of it is in very poor shape. It is, in fact, two separate poems, or parts of them, clumsily put together. The longer one, the ~<Poem~> ~<of~> ~<Hyndla~> proper, is chiefly a collection of names, not strictly mythological but belonging to the semi-historical hero-sagas of Norse tradition. The wise-woman, Hyndla, being asked by Freyja to trace the ancestry of her favorite, Ottar, for the purpose of deciding a wager, gives a complex genealogy including many of the heroes who appear in the popular sagas handed down from days long before the Icelandic settlements. The poet was learned, but without enthusiasm; it is not likely that he composed the ~<Hyndluljoth~> much before the twelfth century, though the material of which it is compounded must have been very much older. Although the genealogies are essentially continental, the poem seems rather like a product of the archÃ¦ological period of Iceland.\n\nInserted bodily in the ~<Hyndluljoth~> proper is a fragment of fifty-one lines, taken from a poem of which, by a curious chance, we know the name. Snorri quotes one stanza of it, calling it \"the short ~<Voluspo~>.\" The fragment preserved gives, of course, no indication of the length of the original poem, but it shows that it was a late and very inferior imitation of the great ~<Voluspo~>. Like the Hyndluljoth proper, it apparently comes from the twelfth century; but there is nothing whatever to indicate that the two poems were the work of the same man, or were ever connected in any way until some blundering copyist mixed them up. Certainly the connection did not exist in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Snorri quoted \"the short ~<Voluspo~>.\"\n\nNeither poem is of any great value, either as mythology or as poetry. The author of \"the short ~<Voluspo~>\" seems, indeed, to have been more or less confused as to his facts; and both poets were",
					
					"too late to feel anything of the enthusiasm of the earlier school. The names of Hyndla's heroes, of course, suggest an unlimited number of stories, but as most of these have no direct relation to the poems of the ~<Edda~>, I have limited the notes to a mere record of who the persons mentioned were, and the saga-groups in which they appeared.\n\n~<Freyja spake:~>\n1. \"Maiden, awake! | wake thee, my friend,\nMy sister Hyndla, | in thy hollow cave!\nAlready comes darkness, | and ride must we\nTo Valhall to seek | the sacred hall.\n\n2. \"The favor of Heerfather | seek we to find,\nTo his followers gold | he gladly gives;\nTo Hermoth gave he | helm and mail-coat,\nAnd to Sigmund he gave | a sword as gift.\n\n[1. Freyja: The names of the speakers do not appear in the manuscripts. On Freyja cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 21 and note; ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note; ~<Lokasenna~>, introductory prose and note. As stanzas 9-10 show, Ottar has made a wager of his entire inheritance with Angantyr regarding the relative loftiness of their ancestry, and by rich offerings (Hyndla hints at less commendable methods) has induced Freyja to assist him in establishing his genealogy. Freyja, having turned Ottar for purposes of disguise into a boar, calls on the giantess Hyndla (\"She-Dog\") to aid her. Hyndla does not appear elsewhere in the poems.\n\n2. ~<Heerfather~>: Othin; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 30. Hermoth: mentioned in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~> as a son of Othin who is sent to Hel to ask for the return of the slain Baldr. ~<Sigmund~>: according to the ~<Volsungasaga~> Sigmund was the son of Volsung, and hence Othin's great-great-grandson (note that Wagner eliminates all the intervening generations by the simple expedient of using]",

Sigmund alone was able to draw from the tree the sword which a mysterious stranger (Othin, of course) had thrust into it (compare the first act of Wagner's ~<Die~> ~<WalkÃ¼re~>).\n\n3. Sijmons suggests that this stanza may be an interpolation.\n\n4. No lacuna after line 2 is indicated in the manuscript. Editors have attempted various experiments in rearranging this and the following stanza.\n\n5. Some editors, following Simrock, assign this whole stanza to Hyndla; others assign to her lines 3-4. Giving the entire stanza to Freyja makes better sense than any other arrangement, but is dependent on changing the manuscript's \"thy\" in line 3 to \"my\", as suggested by Bugge. The boar on which Freyja rides (\"my worthy steed\") is, of course, Ottar.\n\n6. Hyndla detects Ottar, and accuses Freyja of having her]",

Unless Ottar is identical with Oth (cf. Voluspo, 25 and note), which seems most unlikely, there is no other reference to this love affair. ~<The~> ~<way~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<slain~>: the road to Valhall.\n\n7. Various experiments have been made in condensing the stanza into four lines, or in combining it with stanza 8. ~<Hildisvini~> (\"Battle-Swine\"): perhaps Freyja refers to the boar with golden bristles given, according to Snorri, to her brother Freyr by the dwarfs. ~<Dain~>: a dwarf; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 11. ~<Nabbi~>: a dwarf nowhere else mentioned.\n\n8. The first line is obviously corrupt in the manuscript, and has been variously emended. The general assumption is that in the interval between stanzas 7 and 8 Freyja and Hyndla have arrived at Valhall. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscript.\n\n9. ~<Foreign~> ~<metal~>: gold. The word ~<valr~>, meaning \"foreign,\"]",

Glass beads, etc., were of very early use, though the use of glass for windows probably did not begin in Iceland much before 1200.\n\n11. Possibly two stanzas, or perhaps one with interpolations. The manuscript omits the first half of line 4, here filled out from stanza 16, line 2. ~<Skjoldungs~>: the descendants of Skjold, a mythical king who was Othin's son and the ancestor of the Danish kings; cf. Snorri's ~<Edda~>, ~<Skaldskaparmal~>, 43. ~<Skilfings~>: mentioned by Snorri as descendants of King Skelfir, a mythical ruler in \"the East.\" In ~<Grimnismol~>, 54, the name Skilfing appears as one of Othin's many appellations. ~<Othlings~>: Snorri derives this race from Authi, the son of Halfdan the Old (cf. stanza 14). ~<Ylfings~>: some editors have changed this to \"Ynglings,\" as in stanza 16, referring to the descendants of Yng or Yngvi, another son of Halfdan, but the reference may be to the same mythical family to which Helgi Hundingsbane belonged (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 5).]",

Stanzas 25-27 connect Ottar's descent with the whole Volsung-Sigurth-Jormunrek-Gjuki genealogy.

					"~<Svipdagsmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Svipdag~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe two poems, ~<Grougaldr~> (~<Groa's~> ~<Spell~>) and ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~> (the ~<Ballad~> ~<of~> ~<Fjolsvith~>), which many editors have, very wisely, united under the single title of Svipdagsmol, are found only in paper manuscripts, none of them antedating the seventeenth century. Everything points to a relatively late origin for the poems: their extensive use of \"kennings\" or poetical circumlocutions, their romantic spirit, quite foreign to the character of the unquestionably older poems, the absence of any reference to them in the earlier documents, the frequent errors in mythology, and, finally, the fact that the poems appear to have been preserved in unusually good condition. Whether or not a connecting link of narrative verse joining the two parts has been lost is an open question; on the whole it seems likely that the story was sufficiently well known so that the reciter of the poem (or poems) merely filled in the gap with a brief prose summary in pretty much his own words. The general relationship between dialogue and narrative in the Eddic poems is discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>, in connection with the use of prose links.\n\nThe love story of Svipdag and Mengloth is not referred to elsewhere in the ~<Poetic~> ~<Edda~>, nor does Snorri mention it; however, Groa, who here appears as Svipdag's mother, is spoken of by Snorri as a wise woman, the wife of Orvandil, who helps Thor with her magic charms. On the other hand, the essence of the story, the hero's winning of a bride ringed about by flames, is strongly suggestive of parts of the Sigurth-Brynhild traditions. Whether or not it is to be regarded as a nature or solar myth depends entirely on one's view of the whole \"solar myth\" school of criticism, not so highly esteemed today as formerly; such an interpretation is certainly not necessary to explain what is, under any circumstances, a very charming romance told, in the main, with dramatic effectiveness.\n\nIn later years the story of Svipdag and Mengloth became popular throughout the North, and was made the subject of many Danish and Swedish as well as Norwegian ballads. These have greatly assisted in the reconstruction of the outlines of the narrative surrounding the dialogue poems here given.",

A dead woman's curse would naturally be more potent, whether she was Christian or otherwise, than a living one's. Presumably this charm is much older than the poem in which it here stands.\n\n16. At this point Groa's song ends, and Svipdag, thus fortified, goes to seek Mengloth. All the link that is needed between the poems is approximately this: \"Then Svipdag searched long for]",

Most editors have here begun a new series of stanza numbers, but if the ~<Grougaldr~> and the ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~> are to be considered. as a single poem, it seems more reasonable to continue the stanza numbers consecutively. Bugge thinks a stanza has been lost before 17, including Fjolsvith's name, so that the \"he\" in line 1 might have something to refer to. However, just such a prose link as I have suggested in the note on stanza 16 would serve the purpose. Editors have suggested various rearrange merits in the lines of stanzas 17-19. The substance, however, is clear enough. The giant ~<Fjolsvith~> (\"Much-Wise\"), the warder of the house in which Mengloth dwells, sees Svipdag coming and stops him with the customary threats.

					"~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~>\n\n~<The Lay of VÃ¶lund~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nBetween the ~<Thrymskvitha~> and the ~<Alvissmol~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> stands the ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~>. It was also included in the ~<ArnamagnÃ¦an~> ~<Codex~>, but unluckily it begins at the very end of the fragment which has been preserved, and thus only a few lines of the opening prose remain. This is doubly regrettable because the text in ~<Regius~> is unquestionably in very bad shape, and the other manuscript would doubtless have been of great assistance in the reconstruction of the poem.\n\nThere has been a vast amount written regarding the Weland tradition as a whole, discussing particularly the relations between the ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~> and the Weland passage in ~<Deor's~> ~<Lament~>. There can be little question that the story came to the North from Saxon regions, along with many of the other early hero tales. In stanza 16 the Rhine is specifically mentioned as the home of treasure; and the presence of the story in Anglo-Saxon poetry probably as early as the first part of the eighth century proves beyond a doubt that the legend cannot have been a native product of Scandinavia. In one form or another, however, the legend of the smith persisted for centuries throughout all the Teutonic lands, and the name of Wayland Smith is familiar to all readers of Walter Scott, and even of Rudyard Kipling's tales of England.\n\nIn what form this story reached the North is uncertain. Sundry striking parallels between the diction of the ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~> and that of the Weland passage in ~<Deor's~> ~<Lament~> make it distinctly probable that a Saxon song on this subject had found its way to Scandinavia or Iceland. But the prose introduction to the poem mentions the \"old sagas\" in which VÃ¶lund was celebrated, and in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> we have definite evidence of the existence of such prose narrative in the form of the ~<Velentssaga~> (Velent, VÃ¶lund, Weland, and Wayland all being, of course, identical), which gives a long story for which the ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~> can have supplied relatively little, if any, of the material. It is probable, then, that Weland stories were current in both prose and verse in Scandinavia as early as the latter part of the ninth century.",
					
					"Once let a figure become popular in oral tradition, and the number and variety of the incidents connected with his name will increase very rapidly. Doubtless there were scores of Weland stories current in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, many of them with very little if any traditional authority. The main one, however, the story of the laming of the smith by King Nithuth (or by some other enemy) and of Weland's terrible revenge, forms the basis of the ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~>. To this, by way of introduction, has been added the story of VÃ¶lund and the wan-maiden, who, to make things even more complex, is likewise aid to be a Valkyrie. Some critics maintain that these two sections were originally two distinct poems, merely strung together by the compiler with the help of narrative prose links; but the poem as a whole has a kind of dramatic unity which suggests rather that an early poet--for linguistically the poem belongs among the oldest of the Eddic collection--used two distinct legends, whether in prose or verse, as the basis for the composition of a new and homogeneous poem.\n\nThe swan-maiden story appears, of course, in many places quite distinct from the Weland tradition, and, in another form, became one of the most popular of German folk tales. Like the story of Weland, however, it is of German rather than Scandinavian origin, and the identification of the swan-maidens as Valkyries, which may have taken place before the legend reached the North, may, on the other hand, have been simply an attempt to connect southern tradition with figures well known in northern mythology.\n\nThe ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~> is full of prose narrative links, including an introduction. The nature of such prose links has already been discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>; the ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~> is a striking illustration of the way in which the function of the earlier Eddic verse was limited chiefly to dialogue or description, the narrative outline being provided, if at all, in prose. This prose was put in by each reciter according to his fancy and knowledge, and his estimate of his hearers' need for such explanations; some of it, as in this instance, eventually found its way into the written record.\n\nThe manuscript of the ~<VÃ¶lundarkvitha~> is in such bad shape, and the conjectural emendations have been so numerous, that in the notes I have attempted to record only the most important of them.",
					
					"There was a king in Sweden named Nithuth. He had two sons and one daughter; her name was Bothvild. There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns: one was called Slagfith, another Egil, the third VÃ¶lund. They went on snowshoes and hunted wild beasts. They came into Ulfdalir and there they built themselves a house; there was a lake there which is called Ulfsjar. Early one morning they found on the shore of the lake three women, who were spinning flax. Near them were their swan garments, for they were Valkyries. Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland. These did they bring\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Nithuth> (\"Bitter Hater\"): here identified as a king of Sweden, is in the poem (stanzas 9, 15 and 32) called lord of the Njars, which may refer to the people of the Swedish district of Nerike. In any case, the scene of the story has moved from Saxon lands into the Northeast. The first and last sentences of the introduction refer to the second part of the poem; the rest of it concerns the swan-maidens episode. ~<Bothvild~> (\"Warlike Maid\"): VÃ¶lund's victim in the latter part of the poem. ~<King~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<Finns~>: this notion, clearly later than the poem, which calls VÃ¶lund an elf, may perhaps be ascribed to the annotator who composed the prose introduction. The Finns, meaning the dwellers in Lapland, were generally credited with magic powers. ~<Egil~> appears in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> as VÃ¶lund's brother, but ~<Slagfith~> is not elsewhere mentioned. ~<Ulfdalir~> (\"Wolf-Dale\"), ~<Ulfsjar~> (\"Wolf-Sea\"), ~<Valland~> (\"Slaughter-Land\"): mythical, places without historical identification. ~<Valkyries~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31 and note; there is nothing in the poem to identify the three swan maidens as Valkyries except one obscure word in line 2 of stanza 1 and again in line 5 of stanza 5, which may mean, as Gering translates it, \"helmed,\" or else \"fair and wise.\" I suspect that the annotator, anxious to give the Saxon legend as much northern local color as possible, was mistaken in his mythology, and that]",
					
					"home to their hall with them. Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and VÃ¶lund All-Wise. There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles, and came back no more. Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith followed Swan White, but VÃ¶lund stayed in Ulfdalir. He was a most skillful man, as men know from old tales. King Nithuth had him taken by force, as the poem here tells.\n\n1. Maids from the south | through Myrkwood flew,\nFair and young, | their fate to follow;\nOn the shore of the sea | to rest them they sat,\nThe maids of the south, | and flax they spun.\n\n[the poet never conceived of his swan-maidens as Valkyries at all. However, this identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries was not uncommon; cf. ~<Helreith~> ~<Brynhildar~>, 7. The three maidens' names, ~<Hlathguth~>, ~<Hervor~>, and ~<Olrun~>, do not appear in the lists of Valkyries. ~<King~> ~<Hlothver~>: this name suggests the southern origin of the story, as it is the northern form of Ludwig; the name appears again in ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> II, 26, and that of ~<Kjar~> is found in ~<Atlakvitha~>, 7, both of these poems being based on German stories. It is worth noting that the composer of this introductory note seems to have had little or no information beyond what was actually contained in the poem as it has come down to us; he refers to the \"old stories\" about VÃ¶lund, but either he was unfamiliar with them in detail or else he thought it needless to make use of them. His note simply puts in clear and connected form what the verse tells somewhat obscurely; his only additions are making Nithuth a king of Sweden and VÃ¶lund's father a king of the Finns, supplying the name Ulfsjar for the lake, identifying the swan-maidens as Valkyries, and giving Kjar a home in Valland.\n\n1.

If lines 1-2 belong to VÃ¶lund, they mean that Nithuth got his wealth in the Rhine country, and that VÃ¶lund's hoard has nothing to do with it; if the speaker is Nithuth, they mean that VÃ¶lund presumably has not killed a dragon, and that he is far from the wealth of the Rhine, so that he must have stolen his treasure from Nithuth himself.\n\n17.

					"~<Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar~>\n\n~<The Lay of Helgi the Son of Hjorvarth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe three Helgi lays, all found in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, have been the subjects of a vast amount of discussion, in spite of which many of the facts regarding them are still very far from settled. It is, indeed, scarcely possible to make any unqualified statement regarding these three poems for which a flat contradiction cannot be found in the writings of some scholar of distinction. The origin of the Helgi tradition, its connection with that of Sigurth, the authorship, date and home of the poems, the degree to which they have been altered from their original forms, the status of the composer of the copious prose notes: these and many other allied questions have been and probably always will be matters of dispute among students of the ~<Edda's~> history.\n\nWithout attempting to enter into the discussion in detail, certain theories should be noted. Helgi appears originally to have been a Danish popular hero, the son of King Halfdan. Saxo Grammaticus has a good deal to say about him in that capacity, and it has been pointed out that many of the place names in the Helgi lays can be pretty clearly identified with parts of Denmark and neighboring stretches of the Baltic. The Danish Helgi, according to Saxo, was famed as the conqueror of Hunding and Hothbrodd, the latter as the result of a naval expedition at the head of a considerable fleet.\n\nFrom Denmark the story appears to have spread northward into Norway and westward into the Norse settlements among the islands. Not many of its original features remained, and new ones were added here and there, particularly with regard to Helgi's love affair with Sigrun. The victories over Hunding and Hothbrodd, however, were generally retained, and out of material relating to these two fights, and to the Helgi-Sigrun story, were fashioned the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane.\n\nHow the Helgi legend became involved with that of the Volsungs is an open question. Both stories travelled from the South, and presumably about the same time, so it is not unnatural",
					
					"that some confusion should have arisen. At no time, however, was the connection particularly close so far as the actual episodes of the two stories were concerned. In the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane the relationship is established only by the statement that Helgi was the son of Sigmund and Borghild; Sigurth is not mentioned, and in the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth there is no connection at all. On the other hand, Helgi does not appear in any of the Eddic poems dealing directly with the Volsung stories, although in one passage of doubtful authenticity (cf. ~<Reginsmol~>, introductory note) his traditional enemy, Hunding, does, represented by his sons. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> the story of Helgi, including the fights with Hunding and Hothbrodd and the love affair with Sigrun, is told in chapters 8 and 9 without otherwise affecting the course of the narrative. Here, as in the Helgi lays, Helgi is the son of Sigmund Volsungsson and Borghild; Sigurth, on the other hand, is the son of Sigmund and Hjordis, the latter being the daughter of King Eylimi. Still another son, who complicates both stories somewhat, is Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his own sister, Signy. Sinfjotli appears in both of the Helgi Hundingsbane lays and in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, but not in any of the Eddic poems belonging to the Volsung cycle (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note).\n\nThere is a certain amount of resemblance between the story of Helgi and Sigrun and that of Sigurth and Brynhild, particularly as the annotator responsible for the prose notes insists that Sigrun was a Valkyrie. Whether this resemblance was the cause of bringing the two stories together, or whether the identification of Helgi as Sigmund's son resulted in alterations of the love story in the Helgi poems, cannot be determined. The first of the three Helgi poems, the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, is a somewhat distant cousin of the other two. The Helgi in question is apparently the same traditional figure, and he leads a naval expedition, but he is not the son of Sigmund, there is no connection with the Volsung cycle, and his wife is Svava, not Sigrun. At the same time, the points of general resemblance with the two Helgi Hundingsbane lays are such as to indicate a common origin, provided one goes far enough back. The annotator brings the stories together by the naive expedient of having Helgi \"born again,\" and not once only, but twice.",
					
					"The first Helgi lay, is manifestly in bad shape, and includes at least two distinct poems, differentiated not only by subject matter but by metrical form. Although the question is debatable, the longer of these poems (stanzas 1-11 and 31-43) seems in turn to have been compounded out of fragments of two or more Helgi poems. The first five stanzas are a dialogue between a bird and Atli, one of Hjorvarth's followers, concerning the winning of Sigrlin, who is destined to be Hjorvarth's wife and Helgi's mother. Stanzas 6-11 are a dialogue between Helgi and a Valkyrie (the accompanying prose so calls her, and identifies her as Svava, but there is nothing in the verse to prove this). Stanzas 12-30 form a fairly consecutive unit, in which Atli, on guard over Helgi's ship, has a vigorous argument with a giantess, Hrimgerth, whence this section has sometimes been called the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Hrimgerth~>). The last section, stanzas 31-43, is, again fairly consecutive, and tells of the death of Helgi following the rash oath of his brother, Hethin, to win Svava for himself.\n\nParts I, II, and IV may all have come from the same poem or they may not; it is quite impossible to tell surely. All of them are generally dated by commentators not later than the first half of the tenth century, whereas the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> (section III) is placed considerably later. When and by whom these fragments were pieced together is another vexed question, and this involves a consideration of the prose notes and links, of which the ~<Helgakvitha ~<Hjorvarthssonar~> has a larger amount than any other poem in the ~<Edda~>. These prose links contain practically all the narrative, the verse being almost exclusively dialogue. Whoever composed them seems to have been consciously trying to bring his chaotic verse material into some semblance of unity, but he did his work pretty clumsily, with manifest blunders and contradictions. Bugge has advanced the theory that these prose passages are to be regarded as an original and necessary part of the work, but this hardly squares with the evidence.\n\nIt seems probable, rather, that as the Helgi tradition spread from its native Denmark through the Norse regions of the North and West, and became gradually interwoven, although not in essentials, with the other great hero cycle from the South, that of the Volsungs, a considerable number of poems dealing with Helgi were composed, at different times and in different places,",
					
					"reflecting varied forms of the story. Many generations after wards, when Iceland's literary period had arrived, some zealous scribe committed to writing such poems or fragments of poems as he knew, piecing them together and annotating them on the basis of information which had reached him through other channels. The prose notes to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~> frankly admit this patchwork process: a section of four stanzas (13-16) is introduced with the phrase, \"as is said in the Old Volsung Lay\"; the final prose note cites an incident \"told in the ~<Karuljoth~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Kara~>),\" and a two-line speech is quoted \"as it was written before in the ~<Helgakvitha~>.\"\n\nThe whole problem of the origin, character and home of the Helgi poems has been discussed in great detail by Bugge in his ~<Helge-Digtene~> ~<i~> ~<den~> ~<Ãldre~> ~<Edda~>, ~<Deres~> ~<Hjem~> ~<og~> ~<Forbindelser~>, which, as translated by W. H. Schofield under the title ~<The~> ~<Home~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<Eddic~> ~<Poems~>, is available for readers of English. This study is exceedingly valuable, if not in all respects convincing. The whole matter is so complex and so important in the history of Old Norse literature, and any intelligent reading of the Helgi poems is so dependent on an understanding of the conditions under which they have come down to us, that I have here discussed the question more extensively than the scope of a mere introductory note to a single poem would warrant.\n\n~<(I)~>\n\n~<Of Hjorvarth~> ~<and~> ~<Sigrlin~>\n\nHjorvarth was the name of a king, who had four wives: one was called Alfhild, and their son was named Hethin; the second was called SÃ¦reith, and their son was named Humlung; the third was called Sinrjoth, and their son was\n\n[~<Prose~>: In the manuscript the sub-title, \"Of Hjorvarth and Sigrlin,\" stands as the title for the whole poem, though it clearly applies only to the first five stanzas.

					"named Hymling. King Hjorvarth had made a great vow to have as wife whatsoever woman he knew was fairest. He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others, whose name was Sigrlin. Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls; he had a son called Atli, who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king. He dwelt the winter long with King Svafnir. There was a jarl called Franmar, Sigrlin's foster-father; his daughter was named Alof. The jarl told him that the maiden's hand was denied, and Atli went home. Atli, the jarl's son, stood one day in a certain wood; a bird sat in the branches up over him, and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarth's wives the fairest of women. The bird twittered, and Atli hearkened to what it spoke. It said:\n\n[there are two men of that name mentioned in the mythical heroic genealogies of the ~<Hyndluljoth~> (stanzas 23 and 28), and Hjorvarth appears in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I (stanza 14) and II (prose after stanza 12) as a son of Hunding. This particular Hjorvarth is called by the annotator, but not directly so in the verse, a king of Norway. The name means \"Sword-Guardian.\" ~<Four~> ~<wives~>: polygamy, while very. infrequent, appears occasionally in the Norse sagas. ~<Alfhild~>: \"Elf-Warrior.\" ~<Hethin~>: \"Fur-Clothed\" (?). ~<SÃ¦reith~>: \"Sea-Rider.\" ~<Sinrjoth~>: \"Ever-Red.\" The fourth wife, not here named, may be Sigrlin. It has been suggested that SÃ¦reith and Sinrjoth may be northern and southern forms of the same name, as also ~<Humlung~> and ~<Hymling~>, their sons. ~<Svafnir~>: the annotator calls him king of Svavaland, apparently a place on the mainland which could be reached from Norway either by land or by sea. ~<Sigrlin~>: \"The Conquering Serpent.\" ~<Atli~>: Norse form of the Gothic Attila (Etzel). ~<Alof~>: perhaps a feminine form of Olaf. ~<A~> ~<bird~>: compare the counsel given by the birds to Sigurth after the slaying of Fafnir (Fafnismol, stanzas 32-38).

A great bird sat on the housetop to guard it, but he was asleep.

Something is clearly wrong with this stanza, and the manuscript indicates line 6 as the beginning of a new one. Perhaps a line (between lines 4 and 5) has been lost, or perhaps the lines in parenthesis are interpolations. Hrimgerth here refers to Svava, or to the protectress with whom the annotator has identified her, as having saved Helgi and his, ships from the vengeance of the giantesses. In the original line 1 includes Helgi's name, which makes it metrically incorrect.]",

Hethin was coming home alone from the forest one Yule-eve, and found a troll-woman; she rode\n\n[30. Most editions give this stanza to Atli. With this the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> ends, and after the next prose passage the meter reverts to that of the earlier sections.\n\n~<Prose~>. The manuscript does not indicate a new section of the poem. ~<Eylimi~>: cf. note on prose after stanza 9. ~<Valkyrie~>: here, as before, the annotator has apparently nothing but his own imagination on which to base his statement. Svava in the ensuing stanzas certainly does not behave like a Valkyrie. ~<Norway~>: the annotator doubtless based this statement on the reference to Norway in line 2 of stanza 31. ~<Yule-eve~>: the Yule feast, marking the new year, was a great event in the heathen North. It was a time of feasting and merrymaking, vows (\"New Year's resolutions\"), ghosts and witches; the spirits had their greatest power on Yule-eve. ~<The~> ~<king's~> ~<toast~>: vows made at the passing of the king's cup at the Yule feast were particularly sacred. ~<Sacred~> ~<boar~>: a boar consecrated to Freyr, an integral part of the Yule rites.

She said, \"Thou shalt pay for this at the king's toast.\" That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the king's toast. Hethin vowed that he would have Svava, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother. Helgi said:\n\n31. \"Welcome, Hethin! | what hast thou to tell\nOf tidings new | that from Norway come?\nWherefore didst leave | thy land, O prince,\nAnd fared alone | to find us here?\"\n\n~<Hethin spake:~>\n32. \"A deed more evil | I have done\nThan, brother mine, | thou e'er canst mend;\nFor I have chosen | the child of the king,\nThy bride, for mine | at the monarch's toast.\"\n\n[31. ~<From~> ~<Norway~>: Bugge uses this phrase as evidence that the poem was composed in one of the Icelandic settlements of the western islands, but as the annotator himself seems to have thought that Hethin came to Helgi by land (\"on wild paths southward\"), this argument does not appear to have much weight.\n\n32. The second line is conjectural; a line has; clearly been lost from this stanza, and various emendations have been suggested.]",

Some editors place all or part of this prose passage after stanza 35. ~<Following-spirits~>: the \"fylgja\" was a female guardian spirit whose appearance generally betokened death. The belief was common throughout the North, and has come down to recent times in Scottish and Irish folk-lore. Individuals and sometimes whole families had these following-spirits, but it was most unusual for a person to have more than one of them. ~<Alf~>: son of the Hrothmar who killed Helgi's grandfather, and]",

The point, of course, is that Hethin will satisfy Svava's vow by becoming famous as the slayer of Alf. ~<Rogheim~> (\"Rome of Battle\") and ~<Rothulsfjoll~> (\"Sun-Mountain\"): nowhere else mentioned; Hethin means simply that he will not come back to Svava till he has won fame.\n\n~<Prose~>. Regarding this extraordinary bit see the prose note at the end of Helgakvitha ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~>. Gering thinks the reborn Helgi Hjorvarthsson was Helgi Hundingsbane, while Svava, according to the annotator himself, became Sigrun. The point seems to be simply that there were so many Helgi stories current, and the hero died in so many irreconcilable ways, that tradition had to have him born over again, not once only but several times, to accommodate his many deaths, and to avoid splitting him up into several Helgis. Needless to say, the poems themselves know nothing of this rebirth, and we owe the suggestion entirely to the annotator, who probably got it from current tradition.]"

					"~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I~>\n\n~<The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe general subject of the Helgi lays is considered in the introduction to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, and it is needless here to repeat the statements there made. The first lay of Helgi Hundingsbane is unquestionably one of the latest of the Eddic poems, and was composed probably not earlier than the second quarter of the eleventh century. It presents several unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is among the few essentially narrative poems in the whole collection, telling a consecutive story in verse, and, except for the abusive dialogue between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, which clearly was based on another and older poem, it does so with relatively little use of dialogue. It is, in fact, a ballad, and in the main an exceedingly vigorous one. The annotator, who added his prose narrative notes so freely in the other Helgi poems, here found nothing to do. The available evidence indicates that narrative verse was a relatively late development in Old Norse poetry, and it is significant that most of the poems which consist chiefly, not of dialogue, but of narrative stanzas, such as the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay and the two Atli lays, can safely be dated, on the basis of other evidence, after the year 1000.\n\nThe first Helgi Hundingsbane lay is again differentiated from most of the Eddic poems by the character of its language. It is full of those verbal intricacies which were the delight of the Norse skalds, and which made Snorri's dictionary of poetic phrases an absolute necessity. Many of these I have paraphrased in the translation; some I have simplified or wholly avoided. A single line will serve to indicate the character of this form of complex diction (stanza 56, line 4): \"And the horse of the giantess raven's-food had.\" This means simply that wolves (giantesses habitually rode on wolves) ate the bodies of the dead.\n\nExcept for its intricacies of diction, and the possible loss of a stanza here and there, the poem is comparatively simple. The story belongs in all its essentials to the Helgi tradition, with the Volsung cycle brought in only to the extent of making Helgi the son of Sigmund, and in the introduction of Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his sister Signy, in a passage which has",
					
					"little or nothing to do with the course of the narrative, and which looks like an expansion of a passage from some older poem, perhaps from the \"old Volsung lay\" to which the annotator of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay refers (prose after stanza 12). There are many proper names, some of which betray the confusion caused by the blending of the two sets of traditions; for example, Helgi appears indiscriminately as an Ylfing (which presumably he was before the Volsung story became involved) and as a Volsung. Granmar and his sons are called Hniflungs (Nibelungen) in stanza 50, though they seem to have had no connection with this race. The place names have aroused much debate as to the localization of the action, but while some of them probably reflect actual places, there is so much geographical confusion, and such a profusion of names which are almost certainly mythical, that it is hard to believe that the poet had any definite locations in mind.\n\n1. In olden days, | when eagles screamed,\nAnd holy streams | from heaven's crags fell,\nWas Helgi then, | the hero-hearted,\nBorghild's son, | in Bralund born.\n\n2. 'Twas night in the dwelling, | and Norns there came,\nWho shaped the life | of the lofty one;\nThey bade him most famed | of fighters all\nAnd best of princes | ever to be.\n\n[1. The manuscript contains the superscription: \"Here begins the lay of Helgi Hundingbane and h. (Hothbrodd?) The lay of the Volsungs.\" ~<Eagles~>, etc.: the screaming of eagles and water pouring from heaven were portents of the birth of a hero. ~<Borghild~>: Sigmund's first wife; ~<Bralund~> was her home, not Sigmund's.\n\n2. ~<Norns~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 20 and note. Here it is the Norns who]",
					
					"3. Mightily wove they | the web of fate,\nWhile Bralund's towns | were trembling all;\nAnd there the golden | threads they wove,\nAnd in the moon's hall | fast they made them.\n\n4. East and west | the ends they hid,\nIn the middle the hero | should have his land;\nAnd Neri's kinswoman | northward cast\nA chain, and bade it | firm ever to be.\n\n5.

Line 2 is largely guesswork, the manuscript being obscure. ~<Moon's~> ~<hall~>: the sky.\n\n4. ~<East~>, etc.: the Norris give Helgi fame in the East, West, and North; in the North his renown is particularly to endure. This suggests that the poet was aware of the spread of the Helgi story over many lands. ~<Neri's~> ~<kinswoman~>: evidently one of the Norns, but nothing further is known of Neri, and the word may not be a proper name at all.\n\n5. The manuscript indicates no gap, but it looks as though something had been lost after line 2. ~<Ylfings'~> ~<son~>: Sigmund is evidently meant, though calling him an Ylfing (cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 11 and note) is a manifest error. Helgi, in the tradition as it came from Denmark, was undoubtedly an Ylfing, and the poet, in order to combine the two legends, has to treat the Ylfings and Volsungs as if they were the same family.]",
					
					"6. \"In mail-coat stands | the son of Sigmund,\nA half-day old; | now day is here;\nHis eyes flash sharp | as the heroes' are,\nHe is friend of the wolves; | full glad are we.\"\n\n7.

Helgi he named him, | and Hringstathir gave him,\nSolfjoll, SnÃ¦fjoll, | and Sigarsvoll,\nHringstoth, Hotun, | and Himinvangar,\nAnd a blood-snake bedecked | to Sinfjotli's brother.\n\n[6. ~<Sigmund~>: the chief link between the Helgi and Sigurth stories. He was the son of Volsung, great-grandson of Othin. His children by his first wife, Borghild, were Helgi and Hamund (belonging to the Helgi cycle); his son by his second wife, Hjordis, was Sigurth. An incestuous connection with his sister, Signy (cf. Wagner's Siegmund and Sieglinde) resulted in the birth of Sinfjotli (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note).\n\n7. ~<The~> ~<king~>: Sigmund, who gives his son a symbol of the lands which he bestows on him. Regarding the leek, cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 4; ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, 17, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 7.\n\n8. ~<Hringstathir~> (\"Ring-Stead\"): quite possibly the historical Ringsted, long a possession of the Danish kings, and thus a relic of the old Helgi tradition. ~<Hringstoth~> may be another form of the same name. ~<Solfjoll~> (\"Sun-Mountain\") and ~<SnÃ¦fjoll~> (\"Snow-Mountain\") are fictitious names. Regarding ~<Sigarsvoll~> cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, stanzas 8 and 35. Saxo mentions a Danish king named Sigar, and the frequency with which the name appears in the Helgi poems may be taken as a reminiscence of Denmark. ~<Hotun~> (\"High Place\"): possibly the village of Tune in Seeland. ~<Himinvangar~> (\"Heaven's Field\"): an imaginary place. Blood-snake: a sword. ~<Sinfjotli~>: cf. note on stanza 6.]",

Saxo mentions a Hunding who was a Saxon king ruling in Jutland, probably the origin of Helgi's traditional foe.\n\n12. ~<Storm~>, etc.: war.\n\n13. ~<Logafjoll~> (\"Flame-Mountain\"): a mythical name. ~<Frothi~>:]",

In this poem Helgi kills all the sons of Hunding, but in the poems of the Sigurth cycle, and the prose notes attached thereto, Sigmund and his father-in-law, Eylimi, are killed by Hunding's sons, on whom Sigurth subsequently takes vengeance (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and ~<Reginsmol~>).\n\n15. No gap indicated in the manuscript, but almost certainly something has been lost mentioning more specifically the coming of the Valkyries. The lightning which accompanies them suggests again their identification with the clouds (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 28).\n\n16.

Here again there is a confusion of traditions; the Valkyries of the ~<Voluspo~> were as essentially Norse as any part of the older mythology. I doubt if a poet much earlier than the author of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay would have made his Sigrun, daughter of Hogni, a Valkyrie. It is to be noted that the same complication appears in the Sigurth story, where the undoubted Valkyrie, Brynhild-Sigrdrifa (the latter name is really only an epithet) is hopelessly mixed up with the quite human Brynhild, daughter of Buthli.\n\n18. ~<Breaker~> ~<of~> ~<rings~>: generous prince, because the breaking of rings was the customary form of distributing gold.\n\n19. ~<Granmar~>: the annotator gives an account of him and his family in the prose following stanza 12 of ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~>.\n\n20. No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine the stanza with the fragmentary stanza 21, and others fill in with \"And home will carry | Hogni's daughter.\"]",

It has been suggested that this whole passage (stanzas 33-48) is an interpolation, perhaps from \"the Old Volsung lay.\" This may be, but it seems more probable that the poet used an older poem simply as the basis for this passage, borrowing a little but making up a great deal more.

					"~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>\n\n~<The Second Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nAs the general nature of the Helgi tradition has been considered in the introductory note to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, it is necessary here to discuss only the characteristics of this particular poem. The second Helgi Hundingsbane lay is in most respects the exact opposite of the first one: it is in no sense consecutive; it is not a narrative poem, and all or most of it gives evidence of relatively early composition, its origin probably going well back into the tenth century.\n\nIt is frankly nothing but a piece of, in the main, very clumsy patchwork, made up of eight distinct fragments, pieced together awkwardly by the annotator with copious prose notes. One of these fragments (stanzas 13-16) is specifically identified as coming from \"the old Volsung lay.\" What was that poem, and how much more of the extant Helgi-lay compilation was taken from it, and did the annotator know more of it than he included in his patchwork? Conclusive answers to these questions have baffled scholarship, and probably always will do so. My own guess is that the annotator knew little or nothing more than he wrote down; having got the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay, which was obviously in fairly good shape, out of the way, he proceeded to assemble all the odds and ends of verse about Helgi which he could get hold of, putting them together on the basis of the narrative told in the first Helgi lay and of such stories as his knowledge of prose sagas may have yielded.\n\nSection I (stanzas 1-4) deals with an early adventure of Helgi's, -in which he narrowly escapes capture when he ventures into Hunding's home in disguise. Section II (stanzas 5-12) is a dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun at their first meeting. Section III (stanzas 13-16, the \"old Volsung lay\" group) is another dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun when she invokes his aid to save her from Hothbrodd. Section IV (stanzas 17-20, which may well be from the same poem as Section III, is made up of speeches by Helgi and Sigrun after the battle in which Hothbrodd is killed; stanza 21, however, is certainly an interpolation from another poem, as it is in a different meter. Section V (stanzas 22-27) is the dispute between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, evidently",
					
					"in an older form than the one included in the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay. Section VI (stanzas 28-37) gives Dag's speech to his sister, Sigrun, telling of Helgi's death, her curse on her brother and her lament for her slain husband. Section VII (stanza 38) is the remnant of a dispute between Helgi and Hunding, here inserted absurdly out of place. Section VIII (stanzas 39-50) deals with the return of the dead Helgi and Sigrun's visit to him in the burial hill.\n\nSijmons maintains that sections I and II are fragments of the Kara lay mentioned by the annotator in his concluding prose note, and that sections IV, VI, and VIII are from a lost Helgi-Sigrun poem, while Section III comes, of course, from the \"old Volsung lay.\" This seems as good a guess as any other, conclusive proof being quite out of the question.\n\nWere it not for sections, VI and VIII the poem would be little more than a battle-ground for scholars, but those two sections are in many ways as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry. Sigrun's curse of her brother for the slaying of Helgi and her lament for her dead husband, and the extraordinary vividness of the final scene in the burial hill, have a quality which fully offsets the baffling confusion of the rest of the poem.\n\n__________________\n\nKing Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi's foster-father. Hunding was the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior, and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these two, King Hunding and\n\n[~<Prose~>.

Helgi appears to have stayed with Hunding under the name of Hamal, but now, thinking himself safe, he sends word of who he really is. ~<Hunding~>: it has been suggested that the compiler may have inserted this name to fit what he thought the story ought to be, in place of HÃ¦ming, or even Hadding. If stanzas 1-4 are a fragment of the ~<Karuljoth~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Kara~>), this latter suggestion is quite reasonable, for in that poem, which we do not possess, but which supplied material for the compilers of the ~<Hromundar~> ~<saga~> ~<Greipssonar~>, Helgi appears as Helgi Haddingjaskati (cf. final prose note).

He had many sons; one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings' meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni's daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding's sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:\n\n13.

The manuscript indicates no division. Most of this prose passage is evidently based on ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>; the only new features are the introduction of Starkath as a third son of Granmar, which is clearly an error based on a misunderstanding of stanza 19, and the reference to the ~<kings'~> ~<meeting~>, based on stanza 15.

They saw in the air that nine Valkyries were riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land. Granmar's sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:\n\n\"Who is the king | who captains the fleet,\nAnd to the land | the warriors leads?\"\n\nSinfjotli, Sigmund's son, answered him, and that too is written. Gothmund rode home with his tidings of the host;\n\n[~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, which he specifically mentions and even quotes.

There was a great battle, and all Granmar's sons were slain and all their allies; only Dag, Hogni's son, was spared, and he swore loyalty to the Volsungs. Sigrun went among the dead and found Hothbrodd at the coming of death.

Of ~<Hrollaug's~> ~<sons~> nothing further is known. ~<Starkath~>: this name gives a hint of the origin of this stanza, for Saxo Grammaticus tells of the slaying of the Swedish hero Starkath (\"The Strong\") the son of Storverk, and describes how his severed head bit the ground in anger (cf. line 4). In all probability this stanza is from an entirely different poem, dealing with the Starkath story, and the annotator's attempt to identify the Swedish hero as a third son of Granmar is quite without foundation.\n\n21. The difference of meter would of itself be enough to indicate that this stanza comes from an entirely different poem. A few editions assign the whole stanza to Helgi, but lines 3-4. are almost certainly Sigrun's, and the manuscript begins line 3 with a large capital letter following a period.]",

With this stanza begins the dispute between Gothmund and Sinfjotli which, together with Helgi's rebuke to his half brother, appears at much greater length in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 33-48. It is introduced here manifestly in the wrong place. The version here given is almost certainly the older of the two, but the resemblance is so striking, and in some cases (notably in Helgi's rebuke) the stanzas are so nearly identical, that it seems probable that the composer of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay borrowed directly from the poem of which the present dialogue is a fragment. Flag: the banner (\"gunnfani,\" cf. \"gonfalon\") here serves as the signal for war instead of the red shield mentioned in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 34. ~<Battle-light~>: perhaps the \"northern lights.\"\n\n23. Lines 3-4 are obscure, and in the manuscript show signs of error. Helgi had not at this time, so far as we know, conquered any of Hothbrodd's land. ~<The~> ~<realm~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<fishes~>, in line 4, presumably means the sea, but the word here translated \"fishes\" is obscure, and many editors treat it as a proper name, \"the realm of the Fjorsungs,\" but without further suggestion as to who or what the Fjorsungs are.]",

The word here translated ~<swords~> is a conjectural emendation; the manuscript implies merely an invitation to continue the quarrel at Frekastein. ~<Hothbrodd~>: apparently he is here considered as present during the dispute; some editors, in defiance of the meter, have emended the line to mean \"Time is it for Hothbrodd | vengeance to have.\"\n\n26-27.

As this makes the third recorded death of Helgi (once at the hands of Alf, once at those of Dag, and finally in the fight with Hromund), the phenomenon of his rebirth is not surprising. The points of resemblance in all the Helgi stories, including the one told in the lost ~<Karuljoth~>, are sufficiently striking so that it is impossible not to see in them a common origin, and not to believe that Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, Helgi the son of Sigmund and Helgi the Haddings'-Hero (not to mention various other Helgis who probably figured in songs and stories now lost) were all originally the same Helgi who appears in the early traditions of Denmark.]"

					"~<Fra Dautha Sinfjotla~>\n\n~<Of Sinfjotli's Death~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nIt has been pointed out that the Helgi tradition, coming originally from Denmark, was early associated with that of the Volsungs, which was of German, or rather of Frankish, origin (cf. Introductory Note to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>). The connecting links between these two sets of stories were few in number, the main point being the identification of Helgi as a son of Sigmund Volsungsson. Another son of Sigmund, however, appears in the Helgi poems, though not in any of the poems dealing with the Volsung cycle proper. This is Sinfjotli, whose sole function in the extant Helgi lays is to have a wordy dispute with Gothmund Granmarsson.\n\nSinfjotli's history is told in detail in the early chapters of the ~<Volsungasaga~>. The twin sister of Sigmund Volsungsson, Signy, had married Siggeir, who hated his brother-in-law by reason of his desire to possess a sword which had belonged to Othin and been won by Sigmund. Having treacherously invited Volsung and his ten sons to visit him, Siggeir slew Volsung and captured his sons, who were set in the stocks. Each night a wolf (\"some men say that she was Siggeir's mother\") came out of the woods and ate up one of the brothers, till on the tenth night Sigmund alone was left. Then, however, Signy aided him to escape, and incidentally to kill the wolf. He vowed vengeance on Siggeir, and Signy, who hated her husband, was determined to help him. Convinced that Sigmund must have a helper of his own race, Signy changed forms with a witch, and in this guise sought out Sigmund, who, not knowing who she was, spent three nights with her. Thereafter she gave birth to a boy, whom she named Sinfjotli (\"The Yellow-Spotted\"?), whom she sent to Sigmund. For a time they lived in the woods, occasionally turning into wolves (whence perhaps Sinfjotli's name). When Sinfjotli was full grown, he and his father came to Siggeir's house, but were seen and betrayed by the two young sons of Signy and Siggeir, whereupon Sinfjotli slew them. Siggeir promptly had Sigmund and Sinfjotli buried alive, but Signy managed to smuggle Sigmund's famous sword into the grave, and with this the father and son dug themselves out. The next night they burned Siggeir's",
					
					"house, their enemy dying in the flames, and Signy, who had at the last refused to leave her husband, from a sense of somewhat belated loyalty, perishing with him.\n\nWas this story, which the Volsungasaga relates in considerable detail, the basis of an old poem which has been lost? Almost certainly it was, although, as I have pointed out, many if not most of the old stories appear to have been handed down rather in prose than in verse, for the Volsungasaga quotes two lines of verse regarding the escape from the grave. At any rate, Sinfjotli early became a part of the Volsung tradition, which, in turn, formed the basis for no less than fifteen poems generally included in the Eddic collection. Of this tradition we may recognize three distinct parts: the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli story; the Helgi story, and the Sigurth story, the last of these three being by far the most extensive, and suggesting an almost limitless amount of further subdivision. With the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli story the Sigurth legend is connected only by the fact that Sigurth appears as Sigmund's son by his last wife, Hjordis; with the Helgi legend it is not connected directly at all. Aside from the fact that Helgi appears as Sigmund's son by his first wife, Borghild, the only link between the Volsung story proper and that of Helgi is the appearance of Sinfjotli in two of the Helgi poems. Originally it is altogether probable that the three stories, or sets of stories, were entirely distinct, and that Sigurth (the familiar Siegfried) had little or nothing more to do with the Volsungs of northern mythological-heroic tradition than he had with Helgi.\n\nThe annotator or compiler of the collection of poems preserved in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, having finished with the Helgi lays, had before him the task of setting down the fifteen complete or fragmentary poems dealing with the Sigurth story. Before doing this, however, he felt it incumbent on him to dispose of both Sigmund and Sinfjotli, the sole links with the two other sets of stories. He apparently knew of no poem or poems concerning the deaths of these two; perhaps there were none, though this is unlikely. Certainly the story of how Sinfjotli and Sigmund died was current in oral prose tradition, and this story the compiler set forth in the short prose passage entitled ~<Of~> ~<Sinfjotli's~> ~<Death~> which, in ~<Regius~>, immediately follows the second lay of Helgi Hundingsbane. The relation of this passage to the prose of the ~<Reginsmol~> is discussed in the introductory note to that poem.",
					
					"Sigmund, the son of Volsung, was a king in the land of the Franks; Sinfjotli was his eldest son, the second was Helgi, and the third Hamund. Borghild, Sigmund's wife, had a brother who was named -----. Sinfjotli, her stepson, and ----- both wooed the same woman, wherefore Sinfjotli slew him. And when he came home, Borghild bade him depart, but Sigmund offered her atonement-money, and this she had to accept. At the funeral feast Borghild brought in ale; she took poison, a great horn full, and brought it to Sinfjotli. But when he looked into the horn, he saw that it was poison, and said to Sigmund: \"Muddy is the drink, Father!\" Sigmund took the horn and drank therefrom. It is said that Sigmund was so hardy that poison might not harm him, either outside or in, but all his sons could withstand poison only without on their skin. Borghild bore another horn to Sinfjotli and bade him drink, and all happened as before. And yet a third time she brought him a horn, and spoke therewith scornful\n\n[~<Prose~>. Regarding ~<Sigmund~>, ~<Sinfjotli~>, and ~<Volsung~> see Introductory Note. ~<The~> ~<Franks~>: although the Sigurth story had reached the North as early as the sixth or seventh century, it never lost all the marks of its Frankish origin. ~<Helgi~> and ~<Hamund~>: sons of Sigmund and Borghild; Helgi is, of course Helgi Hundingsbane; of Hamund nothing further is. recorded. ~<Borghild~>: the manuscript leaves a blank for the name of her brother; evidently the compiler hoped some day to discover it and write it in, but never did. A few editions insert wholly unauthorized names from late paper manuscripts, such as Hroar, Gunnar, or Borgar. In the ~<Volsungasaga> Borghild bids Sinfjotli drink \"if he has the courage of a Volsung.\" Sigmund gives his advice because \"the king was very drunk, and that was why he spoke thus.\" Gering, on the other hand, gives Sigmund credit for having believed that the draught would deposit its poisonous]",
					
					"words of him if he should not drink from it. He spoke as before with Sigmund. The latter said: \"Let it trickle through your beard, Son!\" Sinfjotli drank, and straight way was dead. Sigmund bore him a long way in his arms, and came to a narrow and long fjord, and there was a little boat and a man in it. He offered to take Sigmund across the fjord. But when Sigmund had borne the corpse out into the boat, then the craft was full. The man told Sigmund to go round the inner end of the fjord. Then the man pushed the boat off, and disappeared.\n\nKing Sigmund dwelt long in Denmark in Borghild's kingdom after he had married her. Thereafter Sigmund went south into the land of the Franks, to the kingdom which he had there. There he married Hjordis, the daughter of King Eylimi; their son was Sigurth. King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding, and Hjordis then married Alf the son of King Hjalprek. There Sigurth grew up in his boyhood. Sigmund and all his sons were far above all other men in might and stature and courage and every kind of ability. Sigurth, however, was the fore most of all, and all men call him in the old tales the noblest of mankind and the mightiest leader.\n\n[contents in Sinfjotli's beard, and thus do him no harm. ~<Boat~>: the man who thus carries off the dead Sinfjotli in his boat is presumably Othin. ~<Denmark~>: Borghild belongs to the Danish Helgi part of the story. The Franks: with this the Danish and Norse stories of Helgi and Sinfjotli come to an end, and the Frankish story of Sigurth begins. Sigmund's two kingdoms are an echo of the blended traditions. ~<Hjordis~>: just where this name came from is not clear, for in the German story Siegfried's mother is Sigelint, but the name of the father of Hjordis, Eylimi, gives a clew, for Eylimi is the father of Svava, wife of Helgi Hjorvarthsson.]",
					
					"[Doubtless the two men are not identical, but it seems likely that both Eylimi and Hjordis were introduced into the Sigmund-Sigurth story, the latter replacing Sigelint, from some version of the Helgi tradition. ~<Hunding~>: in the Helgi lays the sons of Hunding are all killed, but they reappear here and in two of the poems (~<Gripisspo~>, 9, and ~<Reginsmol~>, 15), and the ~<Volsungasaga~> names Lyngvi as the son of Hunding who, as the rejected lover of Hjordis, kills Sigmund and his father-in-law, Eylimi, as well. The episode of Hunding and his sons belongs entirely to the Danish (Helgi) part of the story; the German legend knows nothing of it, and permits the elderly Sigmund to outlive his son. There was doubtless a poem on this battle, for the Volsungasaga quotes two lines spoken by the dying Sigmund to Hjordis before he tells her to give the pieces of his broken sword to their unborn son. ~<Alf~>: after the battle, according to the Volsungasaga, Lyngvi Hundingsson tried to capture Hjordis, but she was rescued by the sea-rover Alf, son of King Hjalprek of Denmark, who subsequently married her. Here is another trace of the Danish Helgi tradition. The ~<Nornageststhattr~> briefly tells the same story.]"

					"~<Gripisspo~> - ~<Gripir's Prophecy~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Gripisspo immediately follows the prose ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and is contained in no other early manuscript. It is unquestionably one of the latest of the poems in the Eddic collection; most critics agree in calling it the latest of all, dating it not much before the year 1200. Its author (for in this instance the word may be correctly used) was not only familiar with the other poems of the Sigurth cycle, but seems to have had actual written copies of them before him; it has, indeed, been suggested, and not without plausibility, that the ~<Gripisspo~> may have been written by the very man who compiled and annotated the collection of poems preserved in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>.\n\nIn form the poem is a dialogue between the youthful Sigurth and his uncle, Gripir, but in substance it is a condensed outline of Sigurth's whole career as told piecemeal in the older poems. The writer was sufficiently skillful in the handling of verse, but he was utterly without inspiration; his characters are devoid of vitality, and their speeches are full of conventional phrases, with little force or incisiveness. At the same time, the poem is of considerable interest as giving, in brief form, a summary of the story of Sigurth as it existed in Iceland (for the ~<Gripisspo~> is almost certainly Icelandic) in the latter half of the twelfth century.\n\nIt is not desirable here to go in detail into the immensely complex question of the origin, growth, and spread of the story of Sigurth (Siegfried). The volume of critical literature on the subject is enormous, and although some of the more patently absurd theories have been eliminated, there are still wide divergencies of opinion regarding many important points. At the same time, a brief review of the chief facts is necessary in order to promote a clearer understanding of the poems which follow, and which make up more than a third of the Eddic collection.\n\nThat the story of Sigurth reached the North from Germany, having previously developed among the Franks of the Rhine country, is now universally recognized. How and when it spread from northwestern Germany into Scandinavia are less certainly known. It spread, indeed, in every direction, so that traces of it",
					
					"are found wherever Frankish influence was extensively felt; but it was clearly better known and more popular in Norway, and in the settlements established by Norwegians, than anywhere else. We have historical proof that there was considerable contact, commercial and otherwise, between the Franks of northwestern Germany and the Norwegians (but not the Swedes or the Danes) throughout the period from 600 to 800; coins of Charlemagne have been found in Norway, and there is other evidence showing a fairly extensive interchange of ideas as well as of goods. Presumably, then, the story of the Frankish hero found its way into Norway in the seventh century. While, at this stage of its development, it may conceivably have included a certain amount of verse, it is altogether probable that the story as it came into Norway in the seventh century was told largely in prose, and that, even after the poets had got hold of it, the legend continued to live among the people in the form of oral prose saga.\n\nThe complete lack of contemporary material makes it impossible for us to speak with certainty regarding the character and content of the Sigurth legend as it existed in the Rhine country in the seventh century. It is, however, important to remember the often overlooked fact that any popular traditional hero became a magnet for originally unrelated stories of every kind. It must also be remembered that in the early Middle Ages there existed no such distinction between fiction and history as we now make; a saga, for instance, might be anything from the most meticulously accurate history to the wildest of fairy tales, and a single saga might (and sometimes did) combine both elements. This was equally true of the Frankish traditions, and the two principles just stated account for most of the puzzling phenomena in the growth of the Sigurth story.\n\nOf the origin of Sigurth himself we know absolutely nothing. No historical analogy can be made to fit in the slightest degree. If one believes in the possibility of resolving hero stories into nature myths, he may be explained in that fashion, but such a solution is not necessary. The fact remains that from very early days Sigurth (Sifrit) was a great traditional hero among the Franks. The tales of his strength and valor, of his winning of a great treasure, of his wooing a more or less supernatural bride, and of his death at the hands of his kinsmen, probably were early features of this legend.\n\nThe next step was the blending of this story with one which",
					
					"had a clear basis in history. In the year 437 the Burgundians, under their king, Gundicarius (so the Latin histories call him), were practically annihilated by the Huns. The story of this great battle soon became one of the foremost of Rhineland traditions; and though Attila was presumably not present in person, he was quite naturally introduced as the famous ruler of the invading hordes. The dramatic story of Attila's death in the year 453 was likewise added to the tradition, and during the sixth century the chain was completed by linking together the stories of Sigurth and those of the Burgundian slaughter. Gundicarius becomes the Gunther of the ~<Nibelungenlied~> and the Gunnar of the Eddic poems; Attila becomes Etzel and Atli. A still further development came through the addition of another, and totally unrelated, set of historical traditions based on the career of Ermanarich, king of the Goths, who died about the year 376. Ermanarich figures largely in many stories unconnected with the Sigurth cycle, but, with the zeal of the medieval story-tellers for connecting their heroes, he was introduced as the husband of Sigurth's daughter, Svanhild, herself originally part of a separate narrative group, and as Jormunrek he plays a considerable part in a few of the Eddic poems.\n\nSuch, briefly, appears to have been the development of the legend before it came into Norway. Here it underwent many changes, though the clear marks of its southern origin were never obliterated. The names were given Scandinavian forms, and in some cases were completely changed (~<e.g.~>, Kriemhild becomes Guthrun). New figures, mostly of secondary importance, were introduced, and a large amount of purely Northern local color was added. Above all, the earlier part of the story was linked with Northern mythology in a way which seems to have had no counterpart among the southern Germanic peoples. The Volsungs become direct descendants of Othin; the gods are closely concerned with Fafnir's treasure, and so on. Above all, the Norse story-tellers and poets changed the figure of Brynhild. In making her a Valkyrie, sleeping on the flame-girt rock, they were never completely successful, as she persisted in remaining, to a considerable extent, the entirely human daughter of Buthli whom Sigurth woos for Gunnar. This confusion, intensified by a mixing of names (cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, introductory note), and much resembling that which existed in the parallel cases of Svava and Sigrun in the Helgi tradition, created difficulties",
					
					"which the Norse poets and story-tellers were never able to smooth out, and which have perplexed commentators ever since.\n\nThose who read the Sigurth poems in the ~<Edda~>, or the story told in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, expecting to find a critically accurate biography of the hero, will, of course, be disappointed. If, how. ever, they will constantly keep in mind the general manner in which the legend grew, its accretions ranging all the way from the Danube to Iceland, they will find that most of the difficulties are simply the natural results of conflicting traditions. just as the Danish Helgi had to be \"reborn\" twice in order to enable three different men to kill him, so the story of Sigurth, as told in the Eddic poems, involves here and there inconsistencies explicable only when the historical development of the story is taken into consideration.\n\n__________________\n\nGripir was the name of Eylimi's son, the brother of Hjordis; he ruled over lands and was of all men the wisest and most forward-seeing. Sigurth once was riding alone and came to Gripir's hall. Sigurth was easy to recognize; he found out in front of the hall a man whose name was Geitir. Then Sigurth questioned him and asked:\n\n1. \"Who is it has | this dwelling here,\nOr what do men call | the people's king?\"\n\n[~<Prose~>. The manuscript gives the poem no title. ~<Gripir~>: this uncle of Sigurth's was probably a pure invention of the poet's. The ~<Volsungasaga~> mentions him, but presumably only because of his appearance here. On ~<Eylimi~> and ~<Hjordis~> see ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note. ~<Geitir~>, the serving-man, is likewise apparently an invention of the poet's.\n\n1. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers anywhere in the poem. Some editors have made separate stanzas out of the two-line speeches in stanzas 1, 3 and 6.]",

Introductory Note). The statement that Sigurth is to go direct from the slaying of Fafnir to Gjuki's hall involves one of the confusions resulting from the dual personality of Brynhild. In the older (and the original South Germanic) story, Sigurth becomes a guest of the Gjukungs before he has ever heard of Brynhild, and first sees her when, having changed forms with Gunnar, he goes to woo her for the latter. In an other version he finds Brynhild before he visits the Gjukungs, only to forget her as the result of the magic-draught administered by Guthrun's mother. Both these versions are represented in the poems of which the author of the ~<Gripisspo~> made use, and he tried, rather clumsily, to combine them, by having Sigurth go to Gjuki's house, then find the unnamed Valkyrie, and then return to Gjuki, the false wooing following this second visit.\n\n15. Basing his story on the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, the poet here tells of Sigurth's finding of the Valkyrie, whom he does not identify with Brynhild, daughter of Buthli (stanza 27), at all. His error in this respect is not surprising, in view of Brynhild's dual identity (cf. Introductory Note, and ~<Fafnismol~>, 44 and note).]",

Edzardi thinks two stanzas have been lost after stanza 33, their remains appearing in stanza 37.\n\n35. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> Grimhild merely advises Gunnar to seek Brynhild for his wife, and to have Sigurth ride with him. ~<Goths~>: the historical Gunnar (Gundicarius, cf. Introductory Note) was not a Goth, but a Burgundian, but the word \"Goth\" was applied in the North without much discrimination to the southern Germanic peoples.]",
					
					"~<Sigurth spake:~>\n36. \"Evil waits me, | well I see it,\nAnd gone is Sigurth's | wisdom good,\nIf I shall woo | for another to win\nThe maiden fair | that so fondly I loved.\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n37. \"Ye three shall | all the oaths then take,\nGunnar and Hogni, | and, hero, thou;\nYour forms ye shall change, | as forth ye tare,\nGunnar and thou; | for Gripir lies not.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n38. \"How meanest thou? | Why make we the change\nOf shape and form | as forth we fare?\nThere must follow | another falsehood\nGrim in all ways; | speak on, Gripir!\"\n\n[17. In the ~<Nibelungenlied~> Siegfried merely makes himself invisible in order to lend Gunther his strength for the feats which must be performed in order to win the redoubtable bride. In the northern version Sigurth and Gunnar change forms, \"as Grimhild had taught them how to do.\" The ~<Volsungasaga~> tells how Sigurth and Gunnar came to Heimir, who told them that to win Brynhild one must ride through the ring of fire which surrounded her hall (cf. the hall of Mengloth in ~<Svipdagsmol~>). Gunnar tries it, but his horse balks; then he mounts Grani, but Grani will not stir for him. So they change forms, and Sigurth rides Grani through the flames. ~<Oaths~>: the blood-brotherhood sworn by Sigurth, Gunnar, and Hogni makes it impossible for the brothers to kill him themselves, but they finally get around the difficulty by inducing their half-brother, Gotthorm (cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 27 and note) to do it.]",
					
					"~<Gripir spake:~>\n39. \"The form of Gunnar | and shape thou gettest,\nBut mind and voice | thine own remain;\nThe hand of the fosterling | noble of Heimir\nNow dost thou win, | and none can prevent.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n40. \"Most evil it seems, | and men will say\nBase is Sigurth | that so he did;\nNot of my will shall | I cheat with wiles\nThe heroes' maiden | whom noblest I hold.\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n41. \"Thou dwellest, leader | lofty of men,\nWith the maid as if | thy mother she were;\nLofty as long | as the world shall live,\nRuler of men, | thy name shall remain.\"\n\n[39. The last half of line 4 is obscure, and the reading is conjectural.\n\n41. Something is clearly wrong with stanzas 41-43. in the manuscript the order is 41, 43, 42, which brings two of Gripir's answers together, followed by two of Sigurth's questions. Some editors have arranged the stanzas as in this translation, while others have interchanged 41 and 43. In any case, Sigurth in stanza 42 asks about the \"three nights\" which Gripir has never mentioned. I suspect that lines 3-4 of stanza 41, which are practically identical with lines 3-4 of stanza 23, got in here by mistake, replacing two lines which may have run thus: \"With thy sword between, | three nights thou sleepest / With her thou winnest | for Gunnar's wife.\" The subsequent poems tell how Sigurth laid his sword Gram between himself and Brynhild.]",
					
					"~<Sigurth spake:~>\n42. \"Shall Gunnar have | a goodly wife,\nFamed among men,-- | speak forth now, Gripir!\nAlthough at my side | three nights she slept,\nThe warrior's bride? | Such ne'er has been.\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n43. \"The marriage draught | will be drunk for both,\nFor Sigurth and Gunnar, | in Gjuki's hall;\nYour forms ye change, | when home ye fare,\nBut the mind of each | to himself remains.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n44. \"Shall the kinship new | thereafter come\nTo good among us? | Tell me, Gripir!\nTo Gunnar joy | shall it later give,\nOr happiness send | for me myself?\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n45. \"Thine oaths remembering, | silent thou art,\nAnd dwellest with Guthrun | in wedlock good;\nBut Brynhild shall deem | she is badly mated,\nAnd wiles she seeks, | herself to avenge.\"\n\n[45. The simultaneous weddings of Sigurth and Gunnar form a memorable feature of the German tradition as it appears in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, but in the ~<Volsungasaga~> Sigurth marries Guthrun before he sets off with Gunnar to win Brynhild.\n\n45. According to the ~<Volsungasaga~>, Sigurth remembers his oaths to Brynhild almost immediately after his return to Gunnar's house. Brynhild, on the other hand, knows nothing until the]",
					
					"~<Sigurth spake:~>\n46. \"What may for the bride | requital be,\nThe wife we won | with subtle wiles?\nFrom me she has | the oaths I made,\nAnd kept not long; | they gladdened her little.\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n47. \"To Gunnar soon | his bride will say\nThat ill didst thou | thine oath fulfill,\nWhen the goodly king, | the son of Gjuki,\nWith all his heart | the hero trusted.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n48. \"What sayst thou, Gripir? | give me the truth!\nAm I guilty so | as now is said,\n\n[famous quarrel between herself and Guthrun at the bath (an other reminiscence of the German story), when she taunts Guthrun with Sigurth's inferiority to Gunnar, and Guthrun retorts with the statement that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the flames.\n\n47. Brynhild tells Gunnar that Sigurth really possessed her during the three nights when he slept by her in Gunnar's form, thus violating his oath. Here again there is a confusion of two traditions. If Sigurth did not meet Brynhild until after his oath to Gunnar (cf. note on stanza 13), Brynhild's charge is entirely false, as she herself admits in ~<Helreith~> ~<Brynhildar~>. On the other hand, according to the version in which Sigurth finds Brynhild before he meets Gjuki's sons, their union was not only completed, but she had by him a daughter, Aslaug, whom she leaves in Heimir's charge before going to become Gunnar's wife. This is the ~<Volsungasaga~> version, and thus the statement Brynhild makes to Gunnar, as a result of which Sigurth is slain, is quite true.]",
					
					"Or lies does the far-famed | queen put forth\nOf me and herself? | Yet further speak.\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n49. \"In wrath and grief | full little good\nThe noble bride | shall work thee now;\nNo shame thou gavest | the goodly one,\nThough the monarch's wife | with wiles didst cheat.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n50. \"Shall Gunnar the wise | to the woman's words,\nAnd Gotthorm and Hogni, | then give heed?\nShall Gjuki's sons, | now tell me, Gripir,\nRedden their blades | with their kinsman's blood?\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n51. \"Heavy it lies | on Guthrun's heart,\nWhen her brothers all | shall bring thee death;\nNever again | shall she happiness know,\nThe woman so fair; | 'tis Grimhild's work.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n\n52. \"Now fare thee well! | our fates we shun not;\nAnd well has Gripir | answered my wish;\nMore of joy | to me wouldst tell\nOf my life to come | if so thou couldst.\"\n\n[50. ~<Gotthorm~>: Gunnar's half-brother, and slayer of Sigurth.\n\n52.

					"~<Reginsmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Regin~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Reginsmol~> immediately follows the ~<Gripisspo~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and in addition stanzas 1, 2, 6, and 18 are quoted in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, and stanzas 11-26 in the ~<Nornageststhattr~>. In no instance is the title of the poem stated, and in ~<Regius~> there stands before the introductory prose, very faintly written, what appears to be \"Of Sigurth.\" As a result, various titles have been affixed to it, the two most often used being \"the Ballad of Regin\" and \"the First Lay of Sigurth Fafnisbane.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is by no means clear that the compiler of the Eddic collection regarded this or either of the two following poems, the ~<Fafnismol~> and the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, as separate and distinct poems at all. There are no specific titles given, and the prose notes link the three poems in a fairly consecutive whole. Furthermore, the prose passage introducing the ~<Reginsmol~> connects directly with ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~>, and only the insertion of the ~<Gripisspo~> at this point, which may well have been done by some stupid copyist, breaks the continuity of the story. For convenience I have here followed the usual plan of dividing this material into distinct parts, or poems, but I greatly doubt if this division is logically sound. The compiler seems, rather, to have undertaken to set down the story of Sigurth in consecutive form, making use of all the verse with which he was familiar, and which, by any stretch of the imagination, could be made to fit, filling up the gaps with prose narrative notes based on the living oral tradition.\n\nThis view is supported by the fact that not one of the three poems in question, and least of all the ~<Reginsmol~>, can possibly be regarded as a unit. For one thing, each of them includes both types of stanza commonly used in the Eddic poems, and this, notwithstanding the efforts of Grundtvig and MÃ¼llenhoff to prove the contrary, is almost if not quite conclusive proof that each poem consists of material taken from more than one source. Furthermore, there is nowhere continuity within the verse itself for more than a very few stanzas. An analysis of the ~<Reginsmol~> shows that stanzas 1-4, 6-10, and 12, all in Ljothahattr stanza form, seem to belong together as fragments of a poem dealing with",
					
					"Loki's (not Andvari's) curse on the gold taken by the gods from Andvari and paid to Hreithmar, together with Hreithmar's death at the hands of his son, Fafnir, as the first result of this curse. Stanza 5, in Fornyrthislag, is a curse on the gold, here ascribed to Andvari, but the only proper name in the stanza, Gust, is quite unidentifiable, and the stanza may originally have had to do with a totally different story. Stanza 11, likewise in Fornyrthislag, is merely a father's demand that his daughter rear a family to avenge his death; there is nothing in it to link it necessarily with the dying Hreithmar. Stanzas 13-18, all in Fornyrthislag, give Regin's welcome to Sigurth (stanzas 13,14), Sigurth's announcement that he will avenge his father's death on the sons of Hunding before he seeks any treasure (stanza 15), and a dialogue between a certain Hnikar, who is really Othin, and Regin, as the latter and Sigurth are on the point of being shipwrecked. This section (stanzas 13-19) bears a striking resemblance to the Helgi lays, and may well have come originally from that cycle. Next follows a passage in Ljothahattr form (stanzas 19-22 and 24-25) in which Hnikar-Othin gives some general advice as to lucky omens and good conduct in battle; the entire passage might equally well stand in the Hovamol, and I suspect that it originally came from just such a collection of wise saws. Inserted in this passage is stanza 23, in Fornyrthislag, likewise on the conduct of battle, with a bit of tactical advice included. The \"poem\" ends with a single stanza, in Fornyrthislag, simply stating that the bloody fight is over and that Sigurth fought well--a statement equally applicable to any part of the hero's career.\n\nFinnur Jonsson has divided the ~<Reginsmol~> into two poems, or rather into two sets of fragments, but this, as the foregoing analysis has indicated, does not appear to go nearly far enough. It accords much better with the facts to assume that the compiler of the collection represented by the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, having set out to tell the story of Sigurth, took his verse fragments pretty much wherever he happened to find them. In this connection, it should be remembered that in the fluid state of oral tradition poems, fragments, and stanzas passed readily and frequently from one story to another. Tradition, never critical, doubtless connected with the Sigurth story much verse that never originated there.\n\nIf the entire passage beginning with the prose ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~>, and, except for the ~<Gripisspo~>, including the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, be regarded as a highly uncritical",
					
					"piece of compilation, rendered consecutive by the compiler's prose narrative, its difficulties are largely smoothed away; any other way of looking at it results in utterly inconclusive attempts to reconstruct poems some of which quite possibly never existed. The twenty-six stanzas and accompanying prose notes included under the heading of ~<Reginsmol~> belong almost wholly to the northern part of the Sigurth legend; the mythological features have no counterpart in the southern stories, and only here and there is there any betrayal of the tradition's Frankish home. The story of Andvari, Loki, and Hreithmar is purely Norse, as is the concluding section containing Othin's counsels. If we assume that the passage dealing with the victory over Hunding's sons belongs to the Helgi cycle (cf. introductory notes to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~> and ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>), there is very little left to reflect the Sigurth tradition proper.\n\nRegarding the general development of the story of Sigurth in the North, see the introductory note to the ~<Gripisspo~>.\n\n__________________\n\nSigurth went to Hjalprek's stud and chose for himself a horse, who thereafter was called Grani. At that time Regin, the son of Hreithmar, was come to Hjalprek's home; he was more ingenious than all other men, and a dwarf in stature; he was wise, fierce and skilled in magic. Regin undertook Sigurth's bringing up and teaching, and loved him much. He told Sigurth of his forefathers, and also of this: that once Othin and HÃ¶nir and Loki had come to Andvari's waterfall, and in the fall were many fish. Andvari was a dwarf, who had dwelt long in the waterfall in the shape of a pike, and there he got his food. \"Otr was the name of a brother of ours,\" said. Regin, \"who often went into the fall in the shape of an otter; he had caught a salmon, and sat on the high bank eating it with his eyes shut. Loki threw a stone at him and killed him; the gods thought they bad had great good luck, and",
					
					"stripped the skin off the otter. That same evening they sought a night's lodging at Hreithmar's house, and showed their booty. Then we seized them, and told them, as ransom for their lives, to fill the otter skin with gold, and completely cover it outside as well with red gold. Then they sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron and got her net, and went then to Andvari's fall and cast the net in front of the pike, and the pike leaped into the net.\" Then Loki said:\n\n1. \"What is the fish | that runs in the flood,\nAnd itself from ill cannot save?\nIf thy head thou wouldst | from hell redeem,\nFind me the water's flame.\"\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Hjalprek~>: father of Alf, Sigurth's step-father; cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~>, and note. ~<Grani~>: cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 5 and note. ~<Regin~> (\"Counsel-Giver\"): undoubtedly he goes back to the smith of the German story; in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> version he is called Mimir, while Regin is there the name of the dragon (here Regin's brother, Fafnir). The ~<Voluspo~> (stanza 12) names a Regin among the dwarfs, and the name may have assisted in making Regin a dwarf here. ~<Hreithmar~>: nothing is known of him outside of this story. Othin, HÃ¶nir and Loki: these same three gods appear in company in ~<Voluspo~>, 17-18. Andvari's fall: according to Snorri, who tells this entire story in the ~<Skaldskaparmal~>, Andvari's fall was in the world of the dark elves, while the one when Loki killed the otter was not; here, however, the two are considered identical. ~<With~> ~<his~> ~<eyes~> ~<shut~>: according to Snorri, Otr ate with his eyes shut because be was so greedy that he could not bear to see the food before him diminishing. ~<Ron~>: wife of the sea-god Ãgir, who draws down drowning men with her net; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 18 and note. Snorri says that Loki caught the pike with his hands.\n\n1. Snorri quotes this stanza. ~<Water's~> ~<game~>: gold, so called because Ãgir, the sea-god, was wont to light his hall with gold.]",

Stanzas 3-4 may well be fragments of some other poem. Certainly Loki's question does not fit the situation, and the passage looks like an extract from some such poem as ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. In ~<Regius~> the phrase \"Loki spake\" stands in the middle of line 1.\n\n4. The manuscript does not name the speaker. ~<Vathgelmir~> (\"Raging to Wade\"): a river not elsewhere mentioned, but cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 39.\n\n~<Prose~>. Snorri says Andvari's ring had the power to create new gold. In this it resembled Baldr's ring, Draupnir; c.f. ~<Skirnismol~>, 21 and note.]",
					
					"he had brought forth all the gold, he held back one ring, and Loki took this from him. The dwarf went into his rocky hole and said:\n\n5. \"Now shall the gold | that Gust once had\nBring their death | to brothers twain,\nAnd evil be | for heroes eight;\njoy of my wealth | shall no man win.\"\n\nThe gods gave Hreithmar the gold, and filled up the otter-skin, and stood it on its feet. Then the gods had to heap up gold and hide it. And when that was done, Hreithmar came forward and saw a single whisker, and bade them cover it. Then Othin brought out the ring Andvaranaut and covered the hair. Then Loki said:\n\n6. \"The gold is given, | and great the price\nThou hast my head to save;\n\n[5. This stanza apparently comes from a different source from stanzas 1-4 (or 1-2 if 3-4 are interpolated) and 6-10; cf. ~<Introductory~> ~<Note~>. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> Andvari lays his curse particularly on the ring. ~<Gust~>: possibly a name for Andvari himself, or for an earlier possessor of the treasure. ~<Brothers~> ~<twain~>: Fafnir and Regin. ~<Heroes~> ~<eight~>: the word \"eight\" may easily have been substituted for something like \"all\" to make the stanza fit the case; the \"eight\" in question are presumably Sigurth, Gotthorm, Gunnar, Hogni, Atli, Erp, Sorli and Hamther, all of whom are slain in the course of the story. But the stanza may originally not have referred to Andvari's treasure at all.\n\n~<Prose~>. ~<Andvaranaut~>: \"Andvari's Gem.\"\n\n6. Snorri quotes this stanza, introducing it, as here, with \"Then Loki said\" in the prose. ~<Regius~> omits this phrase, but inserts \"said Loki\" in line 1.]",

					"But fortune thy sons | shall find not there,\nThe bane of ye both it is.\"\n\n~<Hreithmar spake:~>\n7. \"Gifts ye gave, | but ye gave not kindly,\nGave not with hearts that were whole;\nYour lives ere this | should ye all have lost,\nIf sooner this fate I had seen.\"\n\n~<Loki spake:~>\n8. \"Worse is this | that methinks I see,\nFor a maid shall kinsmen clash;\nHeroes unborn | thereby shall be,\nI deem, to hatred doomed.\"\n\n~<Hreithmar spake:~>\n9. \"The gold so red | shall I rule, methinks,\nSo long as I shall live;\nNought of fear | for thy threats I feel,\nSo get ye hence to your homes.\"\n\nFafnir and Regin asked Hreithmar for a share of the wealth that was paid for the slaying of their brother, Otr.

Apparently, however, the reference is to the fight between Sigurth and the sons of Gjuki over Brynhild.

The manuscript includes \"said Hreithmar\" (abbreviated) in the middle of line 1, and some editors have followed this.]",
					
					"body of his father, Hreithmar, while he was sleeping.

Thereupon Regin asked to have his inheritance from his father, but Fafnir refused this. Then Regin asked counsel\n\n[10. Hreithmar's daughters do not appear elsewhere. It has been suggested that originally stanza 10 was followed by one in which Lofnheith lamented her inability to avenge her father, as she was married and had no son.\n\n11. Apparently an interpolation (cf. Introductory Note). Vigfusson tries to reconstruct lines 2 and 4 to fit the Ljothahattr rhythm, but without much success. Hreithmar urges his daughter, as she has no sons, to bear a daughter who, in turn, will have a son to avenge his great-grandfather. Grundtvig worked out an ingenious theory to fit this stanza, making Sigurth's grand-father, Eylimi, the husband of Lyngheith's daughter, but there is absolutely no evidence to support this. The stanza may have nothing to do with Hreithmar.]",

This and the following stanza may be out of place here, really belonging, together with their introductory prose sentence, in the opening prose passage, following the first sentence describing Regin. Certainly they seem to relate to Regin's first meeting with Sigurth. Stanzas 13-26, interspersed with prose, are quoted in the ~<Nornageststhattr~>.

With this sword Sigurth cleft asunder Regin's anvil. After that Regin egged Sigurth on to slay Fafnir, but he said:\n\n15. \"Loud will the sons | of Hunding laugh,\nWho low did Eylimi | lay in death,\nIf the hero sooner | seeks the red\nRings to find | than his father's vengeance.\"\n\nKing Hjalprek gave Sigurth a fleet for the avenging\n\n[a descendant of Yngvi is, of course, absurd, and the use of this phrase is one of the many reasons for believing that stanzas 13-18 belonged originally to the Helgi cycle. ~<The~> ~<threads~>, etc.: another link with Helgi; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 3-4.

This and the following stanzas are strongly suggestive of the ~<Hovamol~>, and probably came originally from some such collection.\n\n23. This stanza is clearly an interpolation, drawn in by the]",

This stanza almost certainly had nothing originally to do with the others in this passage; it may have been taken from a longer version of the ~<Hovamol~> itself.\n\n~<Prose~>. ~<Lyngvi~>: the son of Hunding who killed Sigmund in jealousy of his marriage with Hjordis; cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note. The ~<Volsungasaga~> names one brother who was with Lyngvi in the battle, Hjorvarth, and Sigurth kills him as readily as if he had not already been killed long before by Helgi. But, as has been seen, it was nothing for a man to be killed in two or three different ways.]",

So Regin took his sword and cleft Lyngvi's back so that he severed his back from his ribs, and then drew out his lungs. So died Lyngvi with great courage.\"\n\n~<Prose~>.

					"~<Fafnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Fafnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe so-called ~<Fafnismol~>, contained in full in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, where it immediately follows the ~<Reginsmol~> without any indication of a break, is quoted by Snorri in the ~<Gylfaginning~> (stanza 13) and the ~<Skaldskaparmal~> (stanzas 32 and 33), and stanzas 6, 3, and 4 appear in the ~<Sverrissaga~>. Although the ~<Volsungasaga~> does not actually quote any of the stanzas, it gives a very close prose parallel to the whole poem in chapters 18 and 19.\n\nThe general character of the ~<Fafnismol~>, and its probable relation to the ~<Reginsmol~> and the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, have been discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Reginsmol~>. While it is far more nearly a unit than the ~<Reginsmol~>, it shows many of the same characteristics. It has the same mixture of stanza forms, although in this case only nine stanzas (32-33, 35-36 and 40-44) vary from the normal Ljothahattr measure. It shows, though to a much less marked extent, the same tendency to introduce passages from extraneous sources, such as the question-and-answer passage in stanzas 11-15. At the same time, in this instance it is quite clear that one distinct poem, including probably stanzas 1-10, 16-23, 25-31, and 34-39, underlay the compilation which we here have. This may, perhaps, have been a long poem (not, however, the \"Lone' Sigurth Lay; see introductory note to ~<Brot~> ~<af~> ~<Sigurtharkvithu~>) dealing with the Regin-Fafnir-Sigurth-Brynhild story, and including, besides most of the ~<Fafnismol~>, stanzas 1-4 and 6-11 of the ~<Reginsmol~> and part of the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, together with much that has been lost. The original poem may, on the other hand, have confined itself to the Fafnir episode. In any case, and while the extant ~<Fafnismol~> can be spoken of as a distinct poem far more justly than the ~<Reginsmol~>, there is still no indication that the compiler regarded it as a poem by itself. His prose notes run on without a break, and the verses simply cover a dramatic episode in Sigurth's early life. The fact that the work of compilation has been done more intelligently than in the case of the ~<Reginsmol~> seems to have resulted chiefly from the compiler's having been familiar with longer consecutive verse passages dealing with the Fafnir episode.",
