	description = "A dark, cold plane, Niflheim is inhabited by icy beings who can thrive in its freezing conditions. The abode of the goddess Hel is located in Niflheim. The plane harbors the souls of the dead who worshiped the Aesir, and yet were deemed unworthy of entry into Asgard by virtue of not having died in battle. In Helheim lies one of the roots of the mighty interplanar tree, Yggdrasill, the root having been corrupted by the dark forces of the plane."
	background = "Niflheim was the ice world of Norse mythology, the encounter of its cold with Muspelheim's heat resulting in the creation of the cosmos. Hel was a part of Niflheim."
