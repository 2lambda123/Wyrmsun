He belongs to the lower strata of his tribe's notables, not being of high enough rank to have a leading position in the clan, but important enough to be granted control of an outpost in the Chaincolt Foothills. Despite being neither ambitious nor adventurous, Rugnur nevertheless ended up being embroiled in the quest to craft the Scepter of Fire for a gnomish monarch." #backstory adapted for Wyrmsun
