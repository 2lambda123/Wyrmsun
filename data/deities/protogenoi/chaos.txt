	description = "Many aeons ago, there was absolute order in the universe. Emptiness and existence were strictly separated. There was virtually naught in the universe but the void, except for a single point of extreme concentration of matter and cosmic energy - all that existed was contained there. In that point (also known as the Singularity), there was no division between the elements, or between the material and the ethereal.\n\nBut then, this absolute order, this radical division between being and non-being, was shattered. That point of concentrated existence burst like an egg, giving birth to the being known as Chaos. Matter and aether spread rapidly out of the original point, expanding throughout the universe." #interpretation of Chaos' role in Greco-Roman cosmogony in light of the Big Bang
