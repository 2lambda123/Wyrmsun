Njord was one of the Vanir who went to dwell in Asgard with the Aesir, accompanied by his two children, Frey and Freyja. At first, the Vanir were worshiped only by elves. As the Aesir were connected to Germanic peoples through their priests, when Njord went to live in Asgard he began to be worshiped by the Germanics as well."
