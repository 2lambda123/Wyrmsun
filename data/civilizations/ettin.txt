	#description = "The ettins of Jotunheim are one of the most ancient sentient peoples to have existed. They possess deep knowledge of mystic forces, passed on by their sages from generation to generation. One of their mystics once discovered another world - Asgard - during a trance. They sought more and more knowledge about those strange lands, until they were able to construct a massive portal leading to the new realm. There they found a group of powerful beings, and soon hostilities erupted between them and the invaders. Though few in number, with their sword and sorcery each of the Asgardians slew scores of ettins. The invasion ended in disaster. Those remaining of the gigantic creatures squirreled towards the portal, as the Asgardians used their powers to destroy it.\n\nDespite the failure of their campaign, the ettins had made a phenomenal advance in their mystic knowledge. Their portal had been destroyed, but the ability to create a new one was now theirs - forever. And as their magic wisdom and their martial prowess grew, they would eventually bring forth heroes capable of taking on the Asgardians."
