Although kobolds can be inventive, their isolation from other communities has made the spread of progress to their lands more difficult. Being the sole intelligent reptilian race in Nidavellir, they feel threatened by the presence of dwarves, gnomes and goblins - all of which they call \"breastlings\"."
