Those who migrated to Scandinavia spoke their own dialect of Indo-European, which eventually would develop into Germanic. Contact with the Celtic peoples to their south was beneficial to the Germanics, as they were able to incorporate more advanced techniques from Central Europe in areas such as metalworking."
