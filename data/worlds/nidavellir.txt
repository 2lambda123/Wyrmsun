	#description = "The dark plains and mountains of Nidavellir are home to the dwarves, gnomes, goblins and kobolds. Of these diminutive races, the gnomes established the first civilization, and the dwarves the greatest. Nidavellir orbits around a star known as Dvalin's Deceiver, which received its name from Dvalin's dislike of sunlight. The legendary dwarf allegedly preferred the dark even more than most dwarves, complaining incessantly if the sunlight caught him unaware during his travels. The Deep Sea which lies to the east of the dwarven realm of Lyr remained unexplored for a long time, until dwarves began building ships robust enough to sail through it. Nidavellir has one moon, which is called \"the Gleamer\". Living beings were first introduced into Nidavellir by the Aesir, who greatly strained themselves to magically transport a few specimens from other worlds. The first contact between dwarves and humans happened in the 23rd century, when an expedition happened upon a dwarven mining operation on a distant planet, resulting in a skirmish."
