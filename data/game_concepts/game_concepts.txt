Any unit can wear boots or drink potions; the latter can be used as a power-up by units who don't have an inventory. Equipping an item will replace the bonuses from weapon technologies with those of the item.\n\nItems are generally dropped by AI-controlled units and buildings, and possess a chance of having a magic affix. Such prefixes and suffixes affect the item's stats, changing its damage, armor and other values. Additionally, unique items also have a chance of dropping. Unique items are often better than magic items, but not necessarily. Items that are neither magic nor unique will disappear five minutes after being dropped.\n\nBesides items, units can also pick up power-ups.
