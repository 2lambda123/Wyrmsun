Wyrms are as territorial as they are rare, and will attack any that they perceive as a threat. Kobolds worship these beasts, believing them to be their ancestors. Some tribes go as far as living near a wyrm's lair, keeping it harmless by maintaining a low profile and feeding it well - sometimes even with offerings of kobolds."
