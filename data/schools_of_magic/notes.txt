Schools of magic represent fields of scholarly investigation into magic, such as alchemy. They are as such distinct from deity domains, which represent a part of a deity's portfolio, though there may be substantial overlap. In general, schools of magic encompass more spells than deity domains, as a scholarly spellcaster can only cast spells from one school of magic, while a priest may cast spells from multiple deity domains.
