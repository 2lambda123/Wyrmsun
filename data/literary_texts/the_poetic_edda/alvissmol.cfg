		text = "[i]The Ballad of Alvis[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nNo better summary of the Alvissmol can be given than Gering's statement that \"it is a versified chapter from the skaldic Poetics.\" The narrative skeleton, contained solely in stanzas 1-8 and in 35, is of the slightest; the dwarf Alvis, desirous of marrying Thor's daughter, is compelled by the god to answer a number of questions to test his knowledge. That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i]. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called \"in each of all the worlds,\" but there is no apparent significance in the fact that the gods call the earth one thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions, or \"kennings.\" Concerning the use of these \"kennings\" in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory note to the [i]Hymiskvitha[/i].\n\nMogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning it to the period of \"the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.\" It appears to have been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,--Thor's questions, for instance, are neatly balanced in pairs,--and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction, but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous poetry. Finnur Jonsson's attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence, which is by no means incompatible with Mogk's theory (cf. introductory note to the [i]Rigsthula[/i]).\n\nThe poem is found only in [i]Regius[/i], where it follows the Thrymskvitha. Snorri quotes stanzas 2c, and 30, the manuscripts of the [i]Prose Edda[/i] giving the name of the poem as [i]Alvissmol[/i], [i]Alsvinnsmol[/i] or [i]Olvismol[/i]. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission, although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily as to defy detection.\n\nThe translation of the many synonyms presents, of course,"

The bride in question is Thor's daughter; Thruth (\"Might\") is the only daughter of his whose name is recorded, and she does not appear elsewhere in the poems. Her mother was Sif, Thor's wife, whereas the god's sons were born of a giantess. [i]Benches[/i]: cf. [i]Lokasenna[/i], 15 and note.\n\n2. The dwarfs, living beyond the reach of the sun, which was fatal to them (cf. stanzas 16 and 35), were necessarily pale. Line 3 is, of course, ironical.\n\n3.

Apparently the gods promised Thor's daughter in marriage to Alvis during her father's absence, perhaps as a reward for some craftsmanship of his (cf. Bugge's suggestion as to stanza 3). The text of line 4 is most uncertain.\n\n5. [i]Hero[/i]: ironically spoken; Alvis takes Thor for a tramp, the god's uncouth appearance often leading to such mistakes; cf. [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 6. Line 4 is a trifle uncertain; some editors alter the wording to read \"What worthless woman bore thee?\"\n\n6. [i]Vingthor[/i] (\"Thor the Hurler\"): cf. [i]Thrymskvitha[/i], 1.

The dwellers \"in hell\" appear in six stanzas; the phrase probably refers to the world of the dead, though Mogk thinks it may mean the dwarfs. In stanzas where the gods are already listed appear names else where applied only to them,--\"holy ones,\" \"sons of the gods\" and \"high ones,\"--as if these names meant beings of a separate race. \"Men\" appears twice in the same stanza, and so do the giants, if one assumes that they are \"the sons of Suttung.\" Altogether it is useless to pay much attention to the mythology of Alvis's replies.\n\n11. Lines I, 2, and 4 of Thor's questions are regularly abbreviated in the manuscript. [i]Beheld[/i], etc.: the word in the manuscript is almost certainly an error, and all kinds of guesses have been made to rectify it.
