	text = "~<The Wise-Woman's Prophecy~>\n\n1. Hearing I ask from the holy races,\nFrom Heimdall's sons, both high and low;\nThou wilt, Valfather, that well I relate\nOld tales I remember of men long ago.\n\n2. I remember yet the giants of yore,\nWho gave me bread in the days gone by;\nNine worlds I knew, the nine in the tree\nWith mighty roots beneath the mold.\n\n3. Of old was the age when Ymir lived;\nSea nor cool waves nor sand there were;\nEarth had not been, nor heaven above,\nBut a yawning gap, and grass nowhere.\n\n4. Then Bur's sons lifted the level land,\nMithgarth the mighty there they made;\nThe sun from the south warmed the stones of earth,\nAnd green was the ground with growing leeks.\n\n5. The sun, the sister of the moon, from the south\nHer right hand cast over heaven's rim;\nNo knowledge she had where her home should be,\nThe moon knew not what might was his,\nThe stars knew not where their stations were.\n\n6. Then sought the gods their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, and council held;\nNames then gave they to noon and twilight,\nMorning they named, and the waning moon,\nNight and evening, the years to number.\n\n7. At Ithavoll met the mighty gods,\nShrines and temples they timbered high;\nForges they set, and they smithied ore,\nTongs they wrought, and tools they fashioned.\n\n8. In their dwellings at peace they played at tables,\nOf gold no lack did the gods then know,--\nTill thither came up giant-maids three, Huge of might, out of Jotunheim.\n\n9. Then sought the gods their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, and council held,\nTo find who should raise the race of dwarfs\nOut of Brimir's blood and the legs of Blain.\n\n10. There was Motsognir the mightiest made\nOf all the dwarfs, and Durin next;\nMany a likeness of men they made,\nThe dwarfs in the earth, as Durin said.\n\n11. Nyi and Nithi, Northri and Suthri,\nAustri and Vestri, Althjof, Dvalin,\nNar and Nain, Niping, Dain,\nBifur, Bofur, Bombur, Nori,\nAn and Onar, Ai, Mjothvitnir.\n\n12. Vigg and Gandalf Vindalf, Thrain,\nThekk and Thorin, Thror, Vit and Lit,\nNyr and Nyrath,-- now have I told--\nRegin and Rathsvith-- the list aright.\n\n13. Fili, Kili, Fundin, Nali,\nHeptifili, Hannar, Sviur,\nFrar, Hornbori, Fræg and Loni,\nAurvang, Jari, Eikinskjaldi.\n\n14. The race of the dwarfs in Dvalin's throng\nDown to Lofar the list must I tell;\nThe rocks they left, and through wet lands\nThey sought a home in the fields of sand.\n\n15. There were Draupnir and Dolgthrasir,\nHor, Haugspori, Hlevang, Gloin,\nDori, Ori, Duf, Andvari,\nSkirfir, Virfir, Skafith, Ai.\n\n16. Alf and Yngvi, Eikinskjaldi,\nFjalar and Frosti, Fith and Ginnar;\nSo for all time shall the tale be known,\nThe list of all the forbears of Lofar.\n\n17. Then from the throng did three come forth,\nFrom the home of the gods, the mighty and gracious;\nTwo without fate on the land they found,\nAsk and Embla, empty of might.\n\n18. Soul they had not, sense they had not,\nHeat nor motion, nor goodly hue;\nSoul gave Othin, sense gave Hönir,\nHeat gave Lothur and goodly hue.\n\n19. An ash I know, Yggdrasil its name,\nWith water white is the great tree wet;\nThence come the dews that fall in the dales,\nGreen by Urth's well does it ever grow.\n\n20. Thence come the maidens mighty in wisdom,\nThree from the dwelling down 'neath the tree;\nUrth is one named, Verthandi the next,--\nOn the wood they scored,-- and Skuld the third.\nLaws they made there, and life allotted\nTo the sons of men, and set their fates.\n\n21. The war I remember, the first in the world,\nWhen the gods with spears had smitten Gollveig,\nAnd in the hall of Hor had burned her,\nThree times burned, and three times born,\nOft and again, yet ever she lives.\n\n22. Heith they named her who sought their home,\nThe wide-seeing witch, in magic wise;\nMinds she bewitched that were moved by her magic,\nTo evil women a joy she was.\n\n23. On the host his spear did Othin hurl,\nThen in the world did war first come;\nThe wall that girdled the gods was broken,\nAnd the field by the warlike Wanes was trodden.\n\n24. Then sought the gods their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, and council held,\nWhether the gods should tribute give,\nOr to all alike should worship belong.\n\n25. Then sought the gods their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, and council held,\nTo find who with venom the air had filled,\nOr had given Oth's bride to the giants' brood.\n\n26. In swelling rage then rose up Thor,--\nSeldom he sits when he such things hears,--\nAnd the oaths were broken, the words and bonds,\nThe mighty pledges between them made.\n\n27. I know of the horn of Heimdall, hidden\nUnder the high-reaching holy tree;\nOn it there pours from Valfather's pledge\nA mighty stream: would you know yet more?\n\n28. Alone I sat when the Old One sought me,\nThe terror of gods, and gazed in mine eyes:\n\"What hast thou to ask? why comest thou hither?\nOthin, I know where thine eye is hidden.\"\n\n29. I know where Othin's eye is hidden,\nDeep in the wide-famed well of Mimir;\nMead from the pledge of Othin each mom\nDoes Mimir drink: would you know yet more?\n\n30. Necklaces had I and rings from Heerfather,\nWise was my speech and my magic wisdom;\n. . . . . . . . . .\nWidely I saw over all the worlds.\n\n31. On all sides saw I Valkyries assemble,\nReady to ride to the ranks of the gods;\nSkuld bore the shield, and Skogul rode next,\nGuth, Hild, Gondul, and Geirskogul.\nOf Herjan's maidens the list have ye heard,\nValkyries ready to ride o'er the earth.\n\n32. I saw for Baldr, the bleeding god,\nThe son of Othin, his destiny set:\nFamous and fair in the lofty fields, Full grown in strength the mistletoe stood.\n\n33. From the branch which seemed so slender and fair Came a harmful shaft that Hoth should hurl; But the brother of Baldr was born ere long, And one night old fought Othin's son.\n\n34. His hands he washed not, his hair he combed not, Till he bore to the bale-blaze Baldr's foe. But in Fensalir did Frigg weep sore For Valhall's need: would you know yet more?\n\n35. One did I see in the wet woods bound, A lover of ill, and to Loki like;\nBy his side does Sigyn sit, nor is glad\nTo see her mate: would you know yet more?\n\n36. From the east there pours through poisoned vales\nWith swords and daggers the river Slith.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n37. Northward a hall in Nithavellir\nOf gold there rose for Sindri's race;\nAnd in Okolnir another stood,\nWhere the giant Brimir his beer-hall had.\n\n38. A hall I saw, far from the sun,\nOn Nastrond it stands, and the doors face north,\nVenom drops through the smoke-vent down,\nFor around the walls do serpents wind.\n\n39. I saw there wading through rivers wild\nTreacherous men and murderers too,\nAnd workers of ill with the wives of men;\nThere Nithhogg sucked the blood of the slain,\nAnd the wolf tore men; would you know yet more?\n\n40. The giantess old in Ironwood sat,\nIn the east, and bore the brood of Fenrir;\nAmong these one in monster's guise\nWas soon to steal the sun from the sky.\n\n41. There feeds he full on the flesh of the dead,\nAnd the home of the gods he reddens with gore;\nDark grows the sun, and in summer soon\nCome mighty storms: would you know yet more?\n\n42. On a hill there sat, and smote on his harp,\nEggther the joyous, the giants' warder;\nAbove him the cock in the bird-wood crowed,\nFair and red did Fjalar stand.\n\n43. Then to the gods crowed Gollinkambi,\nHe wakes the heroes in Othin's hall;\nAnd beneath the earth does another crow,\nThe rust-red bird at the bars of Hel.\n\n44. Now Garm howls loud before Gnipahellir,\nThe fetters will burst, and the wolf run free;\nMuch do I know, and more can see\nOf the fate of the gods, the mighty in fight.\n\n45. Brothers shall fight and fell each other,\nAnd sisters' sons shall kinship stain;\nHard is it on earth, with mighty whoredom;\nAxe-time, sword-time, shields are sundered,\nWind-time, wolf-time, ere the world falls;\nNor ever shall men each other spare.\n\n46. Fast move the sons of Mim, and fate\nIs heard in the note of the Gjallarhorn;\nLoud blows Heimdall, the horn is aloft,\nIn fear quake all who on Hel-roads are.\n\n47. Yggdrasil shakes, and shiver on high\nThe ancient limbs, and the giant is loose;\nTo the head of Mim does Othin give heed,\nBut the kinsman of Surt shall slay him soon.\n\n48. How fare the gods? how fare the elves?\nAll Jotunheim groans, the gods are at council;\nLoud roar the dwarfs by the doors of stone,\nThe masters of the rocks: would you know yet more?\n\n49. Now Garm howls loud before Gnipahellir,\nThe fetters will burst, and the wolf run free\nMuch do I know, and more can see\nOf the fate of the gods, the mighty in fight.\n\n50. From the east comes Hrym with shield held high;\nIn giant-wrath does the serpent writhe;\nO'er the waves he twists, and the tawny eagle\nGnaws corpses screaming; Naglfar is loose.\n\n51. O'er the sea from the north there sails a ship\nWith the people of Hel, at the helm stands Loki;\nAfter the wolf do wild men follow,\nAnd with them the brother of Byleist goes.\n\n52. Surt fares from the south with the scourge of branches,\nThe sun of the battle-gods shone from his sword;\nThe crags are sundered, the giant-women sink,\nThe dead throng Hel-way, and heaven is cloven.\n\n53. Now comes to Hlin yet another hurt,\nWhen Othin fares to fight with the wolf,\nAnd Beli's fair slayer seeks out Surt,\nFor there must fall the joy of Frigg.\n\n54. Then comes Sigfather's mighty son, Vithar, to fight with the foaming wolf; In the giant's son does he thrust his sword Full to the heart: his father is avenged.\n\n55. Hither there comes the son of Hlothyn, The bright snake gapes to heaven above; . . . . . . . . . . Against the serpent goes Othin's son.\n\n56. In anger smites the warder of earth,-- Forth from their homes must all men flee;- Nine paces fares the son of Fjorgyn, And, slain by the serpent, fearless he sinks.\n\n57. The sun turns black, earth sinks in the sea,\nThe hot stars down from heaven are whirled;\nFierce grows the steam and the life-feeding flame,\nTill fire leaps high about heaven itself.\n\n58. Now Garm howls loud before Gnipahellir,\nThe fetters will burst, and the wolf run free;\nMuch do I know, and more can see\nOf the fate of the gods, the mighty in fight.\n\n59. Now do I see the earth anew\nRise all green from the waves again;\nThe cataracts fall, and the eagle flies,\nAnd fish he catches beneath the cliffs.\n\n60. The gods in Ithavoll meet together,\nOf the terrible girdler of earth they talk,\nAnd the mighty past they call to mind,\nAnd the ancient runes of the Ruler of Gods.\n\n61. In wondrous beauty once again\nShall the golden tables stand mid the grass,\nWhich the gods had owned in the days of old,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n62. Then fields unsowed bear ripened fruit,\nAll ills grow better, and Baldr comes back;\nBaldr and Hoth dwell in Hropt's battle-hall,\nAnd the mighty gods: would you know yet more?\n\n63. Then Hönir wins the prophetic wand,\n. . . . . . . . . .\nAnd the sons of the brothers of Tveggi abide\nIn Vindheim now: would you know yet more?\n\n64. More fair than the sun, a hall I see,\nRoofed with gold, on Gimle it stands;\nThere shall the righteous rulers dwell,\nAnd happiness ever there shall they have.\n\n65. There comes on high, all power to hold,\nA mighty lord, all lands he rules.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n66. From below the dragon dark comes forth,\nNithhogg flying from Nithafjoll;\nThe bodies of men on his wings he bears,\nThe serpent bright: but now must I sink."
