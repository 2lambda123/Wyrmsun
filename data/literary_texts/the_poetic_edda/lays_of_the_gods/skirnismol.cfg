		text = "[i]The Ballad of Skirnir[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe [i]Skirnismol[/i] is found complete in the [i]Codex[/i] [i]Regius[/i], and through stanza 27 in the [i]Arnamagnæan[/i] [i]Codex[/i]. Snorri quotes the concluding stanza. In [i]Regius[/i] the poem is entitled \"For Scirnis\" (\"Skirnir's journey\").\n\nThe [i]Skirnismol[/i] differs sharply from the poems preceding it, in that it has a distinctly ballad quality. As a matter of fact, however, its verse is altogether dialogue, the narrative being supplied in the prose \"links,\" concerning which cf. introductory note to the [i]Grimnismol[/i]. The dramatic effectiveness and vivid characterization of the poem seem to connect it with the [i]Thrymskvitha[/i], and the two may possibly have been put into their present form by the same man. Bugge's guess that the Skirnismol was the work of the author of the [i]Lokasenna[/i] is also possible, though it has less to support it.\n\nCritics have generally agreed in dating the poem as we now have it as early as the first half of the tenth century; Finnur Jonsson puts it as early as goo, and claims it, as usual, for Norway. Doubtless it was current in Norway, in one form or another, before the first Icelandic settlements, but his argument that the thistle (stanza 31) is not an Icelandic plant has little weight, for such curse-formulas must have traveled freely from place to place. In view of the evidence pointing to a western origin for many or all of the Eddic poems, Jonsson's reiterated \"Digtet er sikkert norsk og ikke islandsk\" is somewhat exasperating. Wherever the [i]Skirnismol[/i] was composed, it has been preserved in exceptionally good condition, and seems to be practically devoid of interpolations or lacunæ.\n\n__________________\n\nFreyr, the son of Njorth, had sat one day in Hlithskjolf, and looked over all the worlds. He looked into Jotunheim, and saw there a fair maiden, as she went from her father's house to her bower. Forthwith he felt a mighty"

[i]Freyr[/i]: concerning his father, Njorth, and the race of the Wanes in general, cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 21 and note. Snorri thus describes Njorth's family: \"Njorth begat two children in Noatun; the son was named Freyr, and the daughter Freyja; they were fair of aspect and mighty. Freyr is the noblest of the gods; he rules over rain and sunshine, and therewith the fruitfulness of the earth; it is well to call upon him for plenty and welfare, for he rules over wealth for mankind. Freyja is the noblest of the goddesses. When she rides to the fight, she has one-half of the slain, and Othin has half. When she goes on a journey, she drives her two cats, and sits in a cart. Love-songs please her well, and it is good to call on her in love-matters.\" [i]Hlithskjolf[/i]: Othin's watch-tower; cf. [i]Grimnismol[/i], introductory prose. [i]He[/i] [i]said[/i]: both manuscripts have \"Then Skathi said:\" (Skathi was Njorth's wife), but Bugge's emendation, based on Snorri's version, is doubtless correct.\n\n1. [i]My[/i] [i]son[/i]: both manuscripts, and many editors, have \"our son,\" which, of course, goes with the introduction of Skathi in the prose.

This has been tentatively reconstructed, thus: \"Hither to me shalt thou bring the maid, / And home shalt thou lead her here, / If her father wills it or wills it not, / And good reward shalt thou get.\" Finn Magnusen detected the probable omission of a stanza here as early as 1821.\n\n8. [i]The[/i] [i]sword[/i]: Freyr's gift of his sword to Skirnir eventually proves fatal, for at the last battle, when Freyr is attacked by Beli, whom he kills bare-handed, and later when the fire-demon, Surt, slays him in turn, he is weaponless; cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 53 and note.

There were fierce dogs bound before the gate of the fence which was around Gerth's hall.

With this stanza, bribes and threats having failed, Skirnir begins a curse which, by the power of his magic staff, is to fall on Gerth if she refuses Freyr.\n\n27. [i]Eagle's[/i] [i]hill[/i]: the hill at the end of heaven, and consequently overlooking hell, where the giant Hræsvelg sits \"in an eagle's guise,\" and makes the winds with his wings; cf.

The second line is faulty in both manuscripts; Hildebrand's emendation corrects the error, but omits an effective touch; the manuscript line may be rendered \"And look and hanker for hell.\" The Arnamagnæan Codex breaks off with the fourth line of this stanza.\n\n28. [i]Hrimnir[/i]: a frost-giant, mentioned elsewhere only in [i]Hyndluljoth[/i], 33. Line 3 is probably spurious. [i]Watchman[/i] [i]of[/i] [i]the[/i] [i]gods[/i]: Heimdall; cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 46.]"

Three nouns of doubtful meaning, which I have rendered [i]rage[/i], [i]longing[/i], and [i]heart[/i] respectively, make the precise force of this stanza obscure.

In [i]Regius[/i] and in nearly all the editions the first two lines of this stanza are followed by lines 3-5 of stanza 35. I have followed Niedner, Sijmons, and Gering. The two words here translated [i]vile[/i] [i]things[/i] are obscure; Gering renders the phrase simply \"Kobolde.\"\n\n31. The confusion noted as to the preceding stanza, and a metrical error in the third line, have led to various rearrangements and emendations; line 3 certainly looks like an interpolation.
