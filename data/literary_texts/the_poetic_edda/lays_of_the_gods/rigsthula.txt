	text = "~<The Song of Rig~>\n\nThey tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall, went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where he called himself Rig. According to these stories is the following poem:\n\n1. Men say there went by ways so green\nOf old the god, the aged and wise,\nMighty and strong did Rig go striding.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n2. Forward he went on the midmost way,\nHe came to a dwelling, a door on its posts;\nIn did he fare, on the floor was a fire,\nTwo hoary ones by the hearth there sat,\nAi and Edda, in olden dress.\n\n3. Rig knew well wise words to speak,\nSoon in the midst of the room he sat,\nAnd on either side the others were.\n\n4. A loaf of bread did Edda bring,\nHeavy and thick and swollen with husks;\nForth on the table she set the fare,\nAnd broth for the meal in a bowl there was.\n(Calf's flesh boiled was the best of the dainties.)\n\n5. Rig knew well wise words to speak,\nThence did he rise, made ready to sleep;\nSoon in the bed himself did he lay,\nAnd on either side the others were.\n\n6. Thus was he there for three nights long,\nThen forward he went on the midmost way,\nAnd so nine months were soon passed by.\n\n7. A son bore Edda, with water they sprinkled him,\nWith a cloth his hair so black they covered;\nThræll they named him, . . . . .\n\n8. The skin was wrinkled and rough on his hands,\nKnotted his knuckles, . . . . .\nThick his fingers, and ugly his face,\nTwisted his back, and big his heels.\n\n9. He began to grow, and to gain in strength,\nSoon of his might good use he made;\nWith bast he bound, and burdens carried,\nHome bore faggots the whole day long.\n\n10. One came to their home, crooked her legs,\nStained were her feet, and sunburned her arms,\nFlat was her nose; her name was Thir.\n\n11. Soon in the midst of the room she sat,\nBy her side there sat the son of the house;\nThey whispered both, and the bed made ready,\nThræll and Thir, till the day was through.\n\n12. Children they had, they lived and were happy,\nFjosnir and Klur they were called, methinks,\nHreim and Kleggi, Kefsir, Fulnir,\nDrumb, Digraldi, Drott and Leggjaldi,\nLut and Hosvir; the house they cared for,\nGround they dunged, and swine they guarded,\nGoats they tended, and turf they dug.\n\n13. Daughters had they, Drumba and Kumba,\nÖkkvinkalfa, Arinnefla,\nYsja and Ambott, Eikintjasna,\nTotrughypja and Tronubeina;\nAnd thence has risen the race of thralls.\n\n14. Forward went Rig, his road was straight,\nTo a hall he came, and a door there hung;\nIn did he fare, on the floor was a fire:\nAfi and Amma owned the house.\n\n15. There sat the twain, and worked at their tasks:\nThe man hewed wood for the weaver's beam;\nHis beard was trimmed, o'er his brow a curl,\nHis clothes fitted close; in the corner a chest.\n\n16. The woman sat and the distaff wielded,\nAt the weaving with arms outstretched she worked;\nOn her head was a band, on her breast a smock;\nOn her shoulders a kerchief with clasps there was.\n\n17. Rig knew well wise words to speak,\nSoon in the midst of the room he sat,\nAnd on either side the others were.\n\n18. Then took Amma . . . . .\nThe vessels full with the fare she set,\nCalf's flesh boiled was the best of the dainties.\n\n19. Rig knew well wise words to speak,\nHe rose from the board, made ready to sleep;\nSoon in the bed himself did he lay,\nAnd on either side the others were.\n\n20. Thus was he there for three nights long,\nThen forward he went on the midmost way,\nAnd so nine months were soon passed by.\n\n21. A son bore Amma, with water they sprinkled him,\nKarl they named him; in a cloth she wrapped him,\nHe was ruddy of face, and flashing his eyes.\n\n22. He began to grow, and to gain in strength,\nOxen he ruled, and plows made ready,\nHouses he built, and barns he fashioned,\nCarts he made, and the plow he managed.\n\n23. Home did they bring the bride for Karl,\nIn goatskins clad, and keys she bore;\nSnör was her name, 'neath the veil she sat;\nA home they made ready, and rings exchanged,\nThe bed they decked, and a dwelling made.\n\n24. Sons they had, they lived and were happy:\nHal and Dreng, Holth, Thegn and Smith,\nBreith and Bondi, Bundinskeggi,\nBui and Boddi, Brattskegg and Segg.\n\n25. Daughters they had, and their names are here:\nSnot, Bruth, Svanni, Svarri, Sprakki,\nFljoth, Sprund and Vif, Feima, Ristil:\nAnd thence has risen the yeomen's race.\n\n26. Thence went Rig, his road was straight,\nA hall he saw, the doors faced south;\nThe portal stood wide, on the posts was a ring,\nThen in he fared; the floor was strewn.\n\n27. Within two gazed in each other's eyes,\nFathir and Mothir, and played with their fingers;\nThere sat the house-lord, wound strings for the bow,\nShafts he fashioned, and bows he shaped.\n\n28. The lady sat, at her arms she looked,\nShe smoothed the cloth, and fitted the sleeves;\nGay was her cap, on her breast were clasps,\nBroad was her train, of blue was her gown,\nHer brows were bright, her breast was shining,\nWhiter her neck than new-fallen snow.\n\n29. Rig knew well wise words to speak,\nSoon in the midst of the room he sat,\nAnd on either side the others were.\n\n30. Then Mothir brought a broidered cloth,\nOf linen bright, and the board she covered;\nAnd then she took the loaves so thin,\nAnd laid them, white from the wheat, on the cloth.\n\n31. Then forth she brought the vessels full,\nWith silver covered, and set before them,\nMeat all browned, and well-cooked birds;\nIn the pitcher was wine, of plate were the cups,\nSo drank they and talked till the day was gone.\n\n32. Rig knew well wise words to speak,\nSoon did he rise, made ready to sleep;\nSo in the bed himself did he lay,\nAnd on either side the others were.\n\n33. Thus was he there for three nights long,\nThen forward he went on the midmost way,\nAnd so nine months were soon passed by.\n\n34. A son had Mothir, in silk they wrapped him,\nWith water they sprinkled him, Jarl he was;\nBlond was his hair, and bright his cheeks,\nGrim as a snake's were his glowing eyes.\n\n35. To grow in the house did Jarl begin,\nShields he brandished, and bow-strings wound,\nBows he shot, and shafts he fashioned,\nArrows he loosened, and lances wielded,\nHorses he rode, and hounds unleashed,\nSwords he handled, and sounds he swam.\n\n36. Straight from the grove came striding Rig,\nRig came striding, and runes he taught him;\nBy his name he called him, as son he claimed him,\nAnd bade him hold his heritage wide,\nHis heritage wide, the ancient homes.\n\n37. . . . . . . . . . .\nForward he rode through the forest dark,\nO'er the frosty crags, till a hall he found.\n\n38. His spear he shook, his shield he brandished,\nHis horse he spurred, with his sword he hewed;\nWars he raised, and reddened the field,\nWarriors slew he, and land he won.\n\n39. Eighteen halls ere long did he hold,\nWealth did he get, and gave to all,\nStones and jewels and slim-flanked steeds,\nRings he offered, and arm-rings shared.\n\n40. His messengers went by the ways so wet,\nAnd came to the hall where Hersir dwelt;\nHis daughter was fair and slender-fingered,\nErna the wise the maiden was.\n\n41. Her hand they sought, and home they brought her,\nWedded to Jarl the veil she wore;\nTogether they dwelt, their joy was great,\nChildren they had, and happy they lived.\n\n42. Bur was the eldest, and Barn the next,\nJoth and Athal, Arfi, Mog,\nNith and Svein, soon they began-\nSun and Nithjung-- to play and swim;\nKund was one, and the youngest Kon.\n\n43. Soon grew up the sons of Jarl,\nBeasts they tamed, and bucklers rounded,\nShafts they fashioned, and spears they shook.\n\n44. But Kon the Young learned runes to use,\nRunes everlasting, the runes of life;\nSoon could he well the warriors shield,\nDull the swordblade, and still the seas.\n\n45. Bird-chatter learned he, flames could he lessen.,\nMinds could quiet, and sorrows calm;\n. . . . . . . . . .\nThe might and strength of twice four men.\n\n46. With Rig-Jarl soon the runes he shared,\nMore crafty he was, and greater his wisdom;\nThe right he sought, and soon he won it,\nRig to be called, and runes to know.\n\n47. Young Kon rode forth through forest and grove,\nShafts let loose, and birds he lured;\nThere spake a crow on a bough that sat:\n\"Why lurest thou, Kon, the birds to come?\n\n48. \" 'Twere better forth on thy steed to fare,\n. . . . . and the host to slay.\n\n49. \"The halls of Dan and Danp are noble,\nGreater their wealth than thou bast gained;\nGood are they at guiding the keel,\nTrying of weapons, and giving of wounds."
