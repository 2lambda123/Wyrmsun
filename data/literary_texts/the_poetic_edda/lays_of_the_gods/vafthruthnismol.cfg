		text = "[i]The Ballad of Vafthruthnir[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe Vafthruthnismol follows the Hovamol in the [i]Codex[/i] [i]Regius[/i]. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the [i]Arnamagnæan[/i] [i]Codex[/i], the first part evidently having appeared on leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the [i]Prose[/i] [i]Edda[/i], and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.\n\nThe poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god's turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: \"What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?\" Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.\n\nThe whole poem is essentially encyclopædic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the [i]Prose[/i] [i]Edda[/i]. The encyclopædic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the [i]Grimnismol[/i] and the much later [i]Alvissmol[/i] represent different phases of the same type. The [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i] and [i]Grimnismol[/i] together, in deed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i], but it appears to belong to about the same period as the [i]Voluspo[/i]: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition."

Most editors have filled out the stanza with two lines from late paper manuscripts: \"And both of these shall ever be, / Till the gods to destruction go.\" Bugge ingeniously paraphrases Snorri's prose: \"Vindsval's father was Vosuth called, / And rough is all his race.\" [i]Vindsval[/i]: \"the Wind-Cold,\" also called Vindljoni, \"the Wind-Man.\" [i]Svosuth[/i]: \"the Gentle.\"]"

Snorri gives, without materially elaborating on it, the same account of how Ymir's son and daughter were born under his left arm, and how his feet together created a son. That this offspring should have had six heads is nothing out of the ordinary, for various giants had more than the normal number, and Ymir's mother is credited with a little matter of nine hundred heads; cf. [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], 8. Of the career of Ymir's six headed son we know nothing; he may have been the Thruthgelmir of stanza 29.]"
