		text = "[i]The Ballad of the High One[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThis poem follows the [i]Voluspo[/i] in the [i]Codex[/i] [i]Regius[/i], but is preserved in no other manuscript. The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and two lines of stanza 84 appear in one of the sagas.\n\nIn its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other of the Eddic poems. Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened seems to have been somewhat as follows. There existed from very early times a collection of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical proverbs were to Solomon. This collection, which presumably was always elastic in extent, was known as \"The High One's Words,\" and forms the basis of the present poem. To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin. Thus a catalogue of runes, or charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from those comprising the main collection. Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter to insert new stanzas almost at will. This curious miscellany is what we now have as the [i]Hovamol[/i].\n\nFive separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the [i]Hovamol[/i] proper (stanzas 1-80), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life; (2) the [i]Loddfafnismol[/i] (stanzas 111-138), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specific ally addressed to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the [i]Ljothatal[/i] (stanzas 147-165), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing's daughter (stanzas 96-102), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness of women in general (stanzas 81-95), which probably crept into the poem first, and then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin got the mead of poetry--the draught which gave him the gift of tongues--from the maiden Gunnloth (stanzas 103-110). There is also a brief passage (stanzas 139 146) telling how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the [i]Ljothatal[/i], and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason."

		text = "It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this. Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts of it may have originated at a relatively late period. Probably, however, most of its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how or when they first became associated.\n\nIt seems all but meaningless to talk about \"interpolations\" in a poem which has developed almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and ends. The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main divisions of the poem distinct.\n\nFew gnomic collections in the world's literary history present sounder wisdom more tersely expressed than the Hovamol. Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry. If it presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty, truth, and unfaltering courage.\n\n1. Within the gates | ere a man shall go,\n(Full warily let him watch,)\nFull long let him look about him;\nFor little he knows | where a foe may lurk,\nAnd sit in the seats within.\n\n2. Hail to the giver! | a guest has come;\nWhere shall the stranger sit?\nSwift shall he be who, | with swords shall try\nThe proof of his might to make.\n\n[1. This stanza is quoted by Snorri, the second line being omitted in most of the [i]Prose[/i] [i]Edda[/i] manuscripts.\n\n2. Probably the first and second lines had originally nothing to do with the third and fourth, the last two not referring to host or guest, but to the general danger of backing one's views with the sword.]"

With this stanza the subject changes abruptly, and apparently the virtues of fair speech, mentioned in the last three lines, account for the introduction, from what source cannot be known, of the story of Othin and the mead of song (stanzas 104-110).\n\n104. The giant [i]Suttung[/i] (\"the old giant\") possessed the magic mead, a draught of which conferred the gift of poetry. Othin, desiring to obtain it, changed himself into a snake, bored his way through a mountain into Suttung's home, made love to the giant's daughter, Gunnloth, and by her connivance drank up all the mead. Then he flew away in the form of an eagle, leaving Gunnloth to her fate. While with Suttung he assumed the name of Bolverk (\"the Evil-Doer\").\n\n105. [i]Rati[/i] (\"the Traveller\"): the gimlet with which Othin bored through the mountain to reach Suttung's home.]"

The giants, of course, fail to get from Othin the information they seek concerning Bolverk, but Othin is keenly conscious of having violated the most sacred of oaths, that sworn on his ring.\n\n111. With this stanza begins the Loddfafnismol (stanzas 111-138). Loddfafnir is apparently a wandering singer, who, from his \"chanter's stool,\" recites the verses which he claims to have received from Othin. [i]Wells of Urth[/i]: cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 19 and note. Urth (\"the Past\") is one of the three Norns. This stanza is apparently in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting lines as spurious and in rearranging the words and punctuation. It looks rather as though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had crept in later. The phrase translated \"the speech of Hor\" is \"Hova mol,\" later used as the title for the entire poem.]"

Most recent editors have followed Müllenhoff in shifting it to this position, as it appears to conclude the passage introduced by the somewhat similar stanza 111.\n\n139. With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the [i]Hovamol[/i]: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the Ljothatal, or list of charms. Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: \"Othin's Tale of the Runes.\" Apparently stanzas 139, 140 and 142 are fragments of an account of how Othin obtained the runes; 141 is erroneously inserted from some version of the magic mead story (cf. stanzas 104-110); and stanzas 143, 144, 145, and 146 are from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes. With stanza 147 a clearly continuous passage begins once more. [i]The windy tree[/i]: the ash Yggdrasil (literally \"the Horse of Othin,\" so called be cause of this story), on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to himself, and wounded himself with his own spear.

This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin's winning the runes, appears to be an interpolation. The meaning of the stanza is most obscure. Bolthorn was Othin's grandfather, and Bestla his mother. We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned, but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 27 and note, and 47 and note). In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas 104-110). Concerning [i]Othrörir[/i], here used as the name of the vessel containing the mead, cf. stanza 107 and note.\n\n143. This and the following stanza belong together, and in many editions appear as a single stanza. They presumably come from some lost poem on the authorship of the runes. Lines 2 and 3 follow line 4 in the manuscript; the transposition was suggested by Bugge. [i]The[/i] [i]king[/i] [i]of[/i] [i]singers[/i]: Othin.

[i]Alsvith[/i] (\"the All Wise\") appears nowhere else as a giant's name. [i]Myself[/i]: Othin. We have no further information concerning the list of those who wrote the runes for the various races, and these four lines seem like a confusion of names in the rather hazy mind of some reciter.\n\n145. This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with the runes which one \"writes\" and \"tints\" (cf. stanza 79) than with the prayers which one \"asks\" and the sacrifices which one \"offers\" and \"sends.\" Its origin is wholly uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here.
