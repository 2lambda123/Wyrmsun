		text = "[i]Baldr's[/i] [i]Dreams[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\n[i]Baldrs[/i] [i]Draumar[/i] is found only in the [i]Arnamagnæan[/i] [i]Codex[/i], where it follows the [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i] fragment. It is preserved in various late paper manuscripts, with the title [i]Vegtamskvitha[/i] (The Lay of Vegtam), which has been used by some editors.\n\nThe poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been preserved in excellent condition. Its subject-matter and style link it closely with the Voluspo. Four of the five lines of stanza 11 appear, almost without change, in the [i]Voluspo[/i], 32-33, and the entire poem is simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those and the preceding stanzas. It has been suggested that [i]Baldrs[/i] [i]Draumar[/i] and the Voluspo may have been by the same author. There is also enough similarity in style between [i]Baldrs[/i] [i]Draumar[/i] and the [i]Thrymskvitha[/i] (note especially the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson's guess that these two poems had a common authorship. In any case, [i]Baldrs[/i] [i]Draumar[/i] presumably assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth century.\n\nWhether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker in the [i]Voluspo[/i] is purely a matter for conjecture. Nothing definitely opposes such a supposition. As in the longer poem she foretells the fall of the gods, so in this case she prophesies the first incident of that fall, the death of Baldr. Here she is called up from the dead by Othin, anxious to know the meaning of Baldr's evil dreams; in the [i]Voluspo[/i] it is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.\n\nThe poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially dramatic rather than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless familiar to every one who heard the poem recited.\n__________________\n\n1.

After stanza 1 two old editions, and one later one, insert four stanzas from late paper manuscripts.\n\n2.

The manuscript has no superscriptions indicating the speakers. [i]Vegtam[/i] (\"The Wanderer\"): Othin, as usual, conceals his identity, calling himself the son of Valtam (\"The Fighter\"). In this instance he has unusual need to do so, for as the wise-woman belongs apparently to the race of the giants, she would be unwilling to answer a god's questions. [i]Heaven[/i]: the word used includes all the upper worlds, in contrast to hell. [i]Benches[/i], etc.: the adornment of the benches and raised platforms, or elevated parts of the house, was a regular part of the preparation for a feast of welcome. The text of the two last lines is somewhat uncertain.\n\n7. Grundtvig, followed by, Edzardi, thinks a line has been lost between lines 3 and 4.]"

The manuscript marks the third line as the beginning of a stanza; something may have been lost. Lines 3.4 are thoroughly obscure. According to Bugge the maidens who are to weep for Baldr are the daughters of the sea-god Ægir, the waves, whose grief will be so tempestuous that they will toss the ships up to the very sky. \"Yards of the sails\" is a doubtfully accurate rendering; the two words, at any rate in later Norse nautical speech, meant respectively the \"tack\" and the \"sheet\" of the square sail.\n\n13. Possibly two separate stanzas. [i]Enchanter[/i]: the meaning of the original word is most uncertain.]"

[i]Voluspo[/i], 35 and 51, and notes. While the wise-woman probably means only that she will never speak again till the end of the world, it has been suggested, and is certainly possible, that she intends to give Loki her counsel, thus revenging herself on Othin.]"
