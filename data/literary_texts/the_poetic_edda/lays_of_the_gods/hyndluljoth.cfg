		text = "[i]The Poem of Hyndla[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe Hyndluljoth is found in neither of the great manuscripts of the Poetic Edda, but is included in the so-called [i]Flateyjarbok[/i] (Book of the Flat Island), an enormous compilation made some where about 1400. The lateness of this manuscript would of itself be enough to cast a doubt upon the condition in which the poem has been preserved, and there can be no question that what we have of it is in very poor shape. It is, in fact, two separate poems, or parts of them, clumsily put together. The longer one, the [i]Poem[/i] [i]of[/i] [i]Hyndla[/i] proper, is chiefly a collection of names, not strictly mythological but belonging to the semi-historical hero-sagas of Norse tradition. The wise-woman, Hyndla, being asked by Freyja to trace the ancestry of her favorite, Ottar, for the purpose of deciding a wager, gives a complex genealogy including many of the heroes who appear in the popular sagas handed down from days long before the Icelandic settlements. The poet was learned, but without enthusiasm; it is not likely that he composed the [i]Hyndluljoth[/i] much before the twelfth century, though the material of which it is compounded must have been very much older. Although the genealogies are essentially continental, the poem seems rather like a product of the archæological period of Iceland.\n\nInserted bodily in the [i]Hyndluljoth[/i] proper is a fragment of fifty-one lines, taken from a poem of which, by a curious chance, we know the name. Snorri quotes one stanza of it, calling it \"the short [i]Voluspo[/i].\" The fragment preserved gives, of course, no indication of the length of the original poem, but it shows that it was a late and very inferior imitation of the great [i]Voluspo[/i]. Like the Hyndluljoth proper, it apparently comes from the twelfth century; but there is nothing whatever to indicate that the two poems were the work of the same man, or were ever connected in any way until some blundering copyist mixed them up. Certainly the connection did not exist in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Snorri quoted \"the short [i]Voluspo[/i].\"\n\nNeither poem is of any great value, either as mythology or as poetry. The author of \"the short [i]Voluspo[/i]\" seems, indeed, to have been more or less confused as to his facts; and both poets were"

The names of Hyndla's heroes, of course, suggest an unlimited number of stories, but as most of these have no direct relation to the poems of the [i]Edda[/i], I have limited the notes to a mere record of who the persons mentioned were, and the saga-groups in which they appeared.\n\n[i]Freyja spake:[/i]\n1. \"Maiden, awake! | wake thee, my friend,\nMy sister Hyndla, | in thy hollow cave!\nAlready comes darkness, | and ride must we\nTo Valhall to seek | the sacred hall.\n\n2. \"The favor of Heerfather | seek we to find,\nTo his followers gold | he gladly gives;\nTo Hermoth gave he | helm and mail-coat,\nAnd to Sigmund he gave | a sword as gift.\n\n[1.

[i]Voluspo[/i], 21 and note; [i]Skirnismol[/i], introductory prose and note; [i]Lokasenna[/i], introductory prose and note. As stanzas 9-10 show, Ottar has made a wager of his entire inheritance with Angantyr regarding the relative loftiness of their ancestry, and by rich offerings (Hyndla hints at less commendable methods) has induced Freyja to assist him in establishing his genealogy. Freyja, having turned Ottar for purposes of disguise into a boar, calls on the giantess Hyndla (\"She-Dog\") to aid her. Hyndla does not appear elsewhere in the poems.\n\n2. [i]Heerfather[/i]: Othin; cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 30. Hermoth: mentioned in the [i]Prose[/i] [i]Edda[/i] as a son of Othin who is sent to Hel to ask for the return of the slain Baldr. [i]Sigmund[/i]: according to the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] Sigmund was the son of Volsung, and hence Othin's great-great-grandson (note that Wagner eliminates all the intervening generations by the simple expedient of using]"

Sijmons suggests that this stanza may be an interpolation.\n\n4. No lacuna after line 2 is indicated in the manuscript. Editors have attempted various experiments in rearranging this and the following stanza.\n\n5. Some editors, following Simrock, assign this whole stanza to Hyndla; others assign to her lines 3-4. Giving the entire stanza to Freyja makes better sense than any other arrangement, but is dependent on changing the manuscript's \"thy\" in line 3 to \"my\", as suggested by Bugge.

[i]Hildisvini[/i] (\"Battle-Swine\"): perhaps Freyja refers to the boar with golden bristles given, according to Snorri, to her brother Freyr by the dwarfs. [i]Dain[/i]: a dwarf; cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 11. [i]Nabbi[/i]: a dwarf nowhere else mentioned.\n\n8. The first line is obviously corrupt in the manuscript, and has been variously emended.

[i]Ylfings[/i]: some editors have changed this to \"Ynglings,\" as in stanza 16, referring to the descendants of Yng or Yngvi, another son of Halfdan, but the reference may be to the same mythical family to which Helgi Hundingsbane belonged (cf.
