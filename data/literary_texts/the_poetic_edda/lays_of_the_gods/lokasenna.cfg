		text = "[i]Loki's Wrangling[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTES\n\nThe [i]Lokasenna[/i] is found only in [i]Regius[/i], where it follows the [i]Hymiskvitha[/i]; Snorri quotes four lines of it, grouped together as a single stanza.\n\nThe poem is one of the most vigorous of the entire collection, and seems to have been preserved in exceptionally good condition. The exchange or contest of insults was dear to the Norse heart, and the [i]Lokasenna[/i] consists chiefly of Loki's taunt; to the assembled gods and goddesses, and their largely ineffectual attempts to talk back to him. The author was evidently well versed in mythological fore, and the poem is full of references to incidents not elsewhere recorded. As to its date and origin there is the usual dispute, but the latter part of the tenth century and Iceland seem the best guesses.\n\nThe prose notes are long and of unusual interest. The introductory one links the poem closely to the [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], much as the [i]Reginsmol[/i], [i]Fafnismol[/i] and [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i] are linked together; the others fill in the narrative gaps in the dialogue--very like stage directions,--and provide a conclusion by relating Loki's punishment, which, presumably, is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when the poem was recited during the two centuries or so before it was committed to writing, the speaker inserted some such explanatory comments, and the compiler of the collection followed this example by adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The [i]Lokasenna[/i] is certainly much older than the [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], the connection between them being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century compiler evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose work he was annotating.\n\n__________________\n\nÆgir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif,"

[i]Ægir[/i]: the sea-god; Snorri gives Hler as another of his names, but he is not elsewhere called Gymir, which is the name of the giant, Gerth's father, in the Skirnismol. On Ægir cf. [i]Grimnismol[/i], 45, and [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], 1. [i]Frigg[/i]: though Othin's wife is often mentioned, she plays only a minor part in the Eddic poems; cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 34, [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i], I, and [i]Grimnismol[/i], introductory prose. [i]Thor[/i]: the compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor's movements; the \"Journey in the East\" here mentioned cannot be the one described in the [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor through out that expedition. He probably means no more than that Thor was off killing giants. [i]Sif[/i]: concerning Thor's wife the chief incident is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at the command of the wrathful Thor, was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new supply of hair out of gold; cf. [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 48. [i]Bragi[/i]: the god of poetry; cf. [i]Grimnismol[/i], 44 and note. [i]Ithun[/i]: the goddess of youth; cf. note on [i]Skirnismol[/i], 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the Eddic poems, but Snorri tells in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her and her apples, explaining the reference in [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 19 (q. v.). [i]Tyr[/i]: the god of battle; cf. [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], 4, and (concerning his dealings with the wolf Fenrir) [i]Voluspo[/i], 39, note. [i]Njorth[/i]: the chief of the Wanes, and father of Freyr and Freyja; cf. (concerning the whole family) [i]Skirnismol[/i], introductory prose and note, also [i]Voluspo[/i], 21 and note. [i]Skathi[/i]: Njorth's wife was the daughter of the giant Thjazi; cf. [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 19, note, and [i]Grimnismol[/i], 17. [i]Vithar[/i]: the silent god, the son of Othin who avenged his father by slaying the wolf Fenrir; cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 54, [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i], 51, and [i]Grimnismol[/i], 17. [i]Loki[/i]: the mischief-making fire-god; in addition to the many references to his career in the Lokasenna, cf. particularly [i]Voluspo[/i], 32 and 35, and notes. [i]Byggvir[/i] [i]and[/i] [i]Beyla[/i]: not mentioned elsewhere in the poems; Freyr's conspicuous servant is Skirnir, hero of the Skirnismol. [i]Fimafeng[/i] (\"The Swift Handler\")]"

Glittering gold they had in place of firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the peace. The guests praised much the ability of Ægir's serving-men. Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir. Loki spoke to him:\n\n1. \"Speak now, Eldir, | for not one step\nFarther shalt thou fare;\nWhat ale-talk here | do they have within,\nThe sons of the glorious gods?\"\n\n[i]Eldir spake:[/i]\n2. \"Of their weapons they talk, | and their might in war,\nThe sons of the glorious gods;\nFrom the gods and elves | who are gathered here\nNo friend in words shalt thou find.\"\n\n[i]Loki spake:[/i]\n3. \"In shall I go | into Ægir's hall,\nFor the feast I fain would see;\n\n[and [i]Eldir[/i] (\"The Man of the Fire\"): mentioned only in connection with this incident.

Why Loki taunts him with cowardice (stanzas 11-13-15) is not clear, for poetry, of which Bragi was the patron, was generally associated in the Norse mind with peculiar valor, and most of the skaldic poets were likewise noted fighters.\n\n9. There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus swore blood-brotherhood, but they were so often allied in enterprises that the idea is wholly reasonable. The common process of \"mingling blood\" was carried out quite literally, and the promise of -which Loki speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied the ceremony; cf. Brot af Sigurtharkvithu, 18 and note.\n\n10. In stanzas 10-31 the manuscript has nothing to indicate the identity of the several speakers, but these are uniformly clear]"

[i]Ithun[/i]: Bragi's wife; cf. note on introductory prose. The goddesses who, finding that their husbands are getting the worst of it, take up the cudgels with Loki, all find themselves confronted with undeniable facts in their own careers; cf. stanzas 26 (Frigg), 52 (Skathi) and 54 (Sif). Gefjun and Freyja are silenced in similar fashion.

Snorri quotes line 1; cf. note on stanza 29.\n\n23. There is no other reference to Loki's having spent eight years underground, or to his cow-milking. On one occasion, however, he did bear offspring. A giant had undertaken to build the gods a fortress, his reward being Freyja and the sun and moon, provided the work was done by a given time. His sole helper was his horse, Svathilfari.

Skathi: the wife of Njorth, and daughter of the giant Thjazi, concerning whose death cf. [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 19, note. Bowels, etc.: according to the prose note at the end of the [i]Lokasenna[/i], the gods bound Loki with the bowels of his son Vali, and changed his other son, Narfi, into a wolf. Snorri turns the story about Vali being the wolf, who tears his brother to pieces, the gods then using Narfi's intestines to bind Loki. Narfi--and presumably Vali--were the sons of Loki and his wife, Sigyn. They appear only in this episode, though Narfi (or Nari) is named by Snorri in his list of Loki's children.
