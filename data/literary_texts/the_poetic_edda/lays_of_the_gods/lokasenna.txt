	text = "~<Loki's Wrangling~>\n\nÆgir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif, Thor's wife, was there, and Brag, with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but one hand, was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when they had bound him. There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin. Loki was there, and Freyr's servants Byggvir and Beyla. Many were there of the gods and elves.\n\nÆgir had two serving-men, Fimafeng and Eldir. Glittering gold they had in place of firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the peace. The guests praised much the ability of Ægir's serving-men. Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir. Loki spoke to him:\n\n1. \"Speak now, Eldir, for not one step\nFarther shalt thou fare;\nWhat ale-talk here do they have within,\nThe sons of the glorious gods?\"\n\n<i>Eldir spake:</i>\n2. \"Of their weapons they talk, and their might in war,\nThe sons of the glorious gods;\nFrom the gods and elves who are gathered here\nNo friend in words shalt thou find.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n3. \"In shall I go into Ægir's hall,\nFor the feast I fain would see;\nBale and hatred I bring to the gods,\nAnd their mead with venom I mix.\"\n\n<i>Eldir spake:</i>\n4. \"If in thou goest to Ægir's hall,\nAnd fain the feast wouldst see,\nAnd with slander and spite wouldst sprinkle the gods,\nThink well lest they wipe it on thee.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n5. \"Bethink thee, Eldir, if thou and I\nShall strive with spiteful speech;\nRicher I grow in ready words\nIf thou speakest too much to me.\"\n\nThen Loki went into the hall, but when they who were there saw who had entered, they were all silent.\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n6. \"Thirsty I come into this thine hall,\nI, Lopt, from a journey long,\nTo ask of the gods that one should give\nFair mead for a drink to me.\n\n7. \"Why sit ye silent, swollen with pride,\nYe gods, and no answer give?\nAt your feast a place and a seat prepare me,\nOr bid me forth to fare.\"\n\n<i>Bragi spake:</i>\n8. \"A place and a seat will the gods prepare\nNo more in their midst for thee;\nFor the gods know well what men they wish\nTo find at their mighty feasts.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n9. \"Remember, Othin, in olden days\nThat we both our blood have mixed;\nThen didst thou promise no ale to pour,\nUnless it were brought for us both.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n10. \"Stand forth then, Vithar, and let the wolf's father\nFind a seat at our feast;\nLest evil should Loki speak aloud\nHere within Ægir's hall.\"\n\nThen Vithar arose and poured drink for Loki; but before he drank he spoke to the gods:\n\n11. \"Hail to you, gods! ye goddesses, hail!\nHail to the holy throng!\nSave for the god who yonder sits,\nBragi there on the bench.\"\n\n<i>Bragi spake:</i>\n12. \"A horse and a sword from my hoard will I give,\nAnd a ring gives Bragi to boot,\nThat hatred thou makst not among the gods;\nSo rouse not the great ones to wrath.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n13. \"In horses and rings thou shalt never be rich,\nBragi, but both shalt thou lack;\nOf the gods and elves here together met\nLeast brave in battle art thou,\n(And shyest thou art of the shot.)\"\n\n<i>Bragi spake:</i>\n14. \"Now were I without as I am within,\nAnd here in Ægir's hall,\nThine head would I bear in mine hands away,\nAnd pay thee the price of thy lies.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n15. \"In thy seat art thou bold, not so are thy deeds,\nBragi, adorner of benches!\nGo out and fight if angered thou feelest,\nNo hero such forethought has.\"\n\n<i>Ithun spake:</i>\n16. \"Well, prithee, Bragi, his kinship weigh,\nSince chosen as wish-son he was;\nAnd speak not to Loki such words of spite\nHere within Ægir's hall.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n17. \"Be silent, Ithun! thou art, I say,\nOf women most lustful in love,\nSince thou thy washed-bright arms didst wind\nAbout thy brother's slayer.\"\n\n<i>Ithun spake:</i>\n18. \"To Loki I speak not with spiteful words\nHere within Ægir's hall;\nAnd Bragi I calm, who is hot with beer,\nFor I wish not that fierce they should fight.\"\n\n<i>Gefjun spake:</i>\n19. \"Why, ye gods twain, with bitter tongues\nRaise hate among us here?\nLoki is famed for his mockery foul,\nAnd the dwellers in heaven he hates.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n20. \"Be silent, Gefjun! for now shall I say\nWho led thee to evil life;\nThe boy so fair gave a necklace bright,\nAnd about him thy leg was laid.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n21. \"Mad art thou, Loki, and little of wit,\nThe wrath of Gefjun to rouse;\nFor the fate that is set for all she sees,\nEven as I, methinks.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n22. \"Be silent, Othin! not justly thou settest\nThe fate of the fight among men;\nOft gavst thou to him who deserved not the gift,\nTo the baser, the battle's prize.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n23. \"Though I gave to him who deserved not the gift,\nTo the baser, the battle's prize;\nWinters eight wast thou under the earth,\nMilking the cows as a maid,\n(Ay, and babes didst thou bear;\nUnmanly thy soul must seem.)\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n24. \"They say that with spells in Samsey once\nLike witches with charms didst thou work;\nAnd in witch's guise among men didst thou go;\nUnmanly thy soul must seem.\"\n\n<i>Frigg spake:</i>\n25. \"Of the deeds ye two of old have done\nYe should make no speech among men;\nWhate'er ye have done in days gone by,\nOld tales should ne'er be told.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n26. \"Be silent, Frigg! thou art Fjorgyn's wife,\nBut ever lustful in love;\nFor Vili and Ve, thou wife of Vithrir,\nBoth in thy bosom have lain.\"\n\n<i>Frigg spake:</i>\n27. \"If a son like Baldr were by me now,\nHere within Ægir's hall,\nFrom the sons of the gods thou shouldst go not forth\nTill thy fierceness in fight were tried.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n28. \"Thou wilt then, Frigg, that further I tell\nOf the ill that now I know;\nMine is the blame that Baldr no more\nThou seest ride home to the hall.\"\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n29. \"Mad art thou, Loki, that known thou makest\nThe wrong and shame thou hast wrought;\nThe fate of all does Frigg know well,\nThough herself she says it not.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n30. \"Be silent, Freyja! for fully I know thee,\nSinless thou art not thyself;\nOf the gods and elves who are gathered here,\nEach one as thy lover has lain.\"\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n31. \"False is thy tongue, and soon shalt thou find\nThat it sings thee an evil song;\nThe gods are wroth, and the goddesses all,\nAnd in grief shalt thou homeward go.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n32. \"Be silent, Freyja! thou foulest witch,\nAnd steeped full sore in sin;\nIn the arms of thy brother the bright gods caught thee\nWhen Freyja her wind set free.\"\n\n<i>Njorth spake:</i>\n33. \"Small ill does it work though a woman may have\nA lord or a lover or both;\nBut a wonder it is that this womanish god\nComes hither, though babes he has borne.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n34. \"Be silent, Njorth; thou wast eastward sent,\nTo the gods as a hostage given;\nAnd the daughters of Hymir their privy had\nWhen use did they make of thy mouth.\"\n\n<i>Njorth spake:</i>\n35. \"Great was my gain, though long was I gone,\nTo the gods as a hostage given;\nThe son did I have whom no man hates,\nAnd foremost of gods is found.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n36. \"Give heed now, Njorth, nor boast too high,\nNo longer I hold it hid;\nWith thy sister hadst thou so fair a son,\nThus hadst thou no worse a hope.\"\n\n<i>Tyr spake:</i>\n37. \"Of the heroes brave is Freyr the best\nHere in the home of the gods;\nHe harms not maids nor the wives of men,\nAnd the bound from their fetters he frees.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n38. \"Be silent, Tyr! for between two men\nFriendship thou ne'er couldst fashion;\nFain would I tell how Fenrir once\nThy right hand rent from thee.\"\n\n<i>Tyr spake:</i>\n39. \"My hand do I lack, but Hrothvitnir thou,\nAnd the loss brings longing to both;\nIll fares the wolf who shall ever await\nIn fetters the fall of the gods.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n40. \"Be silent, Tyr! for a son with me\nThy wife once chanced to win;\nNot a penny, methinks, wast thou paid for the wrong,\nNor wast righted an inch, poor wretch.\"\n\n<i>Freyr spake:</i>\n41. \"By the mouth of the river the wolf remains\nTill the gods to destruction go;\nThou too shalt soon, if thy tongue is not stilled,\nBe fettered, thou forger of ill.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n42. \"The daughter of Gymir with gold didst thou buy,\nAnd sold thy sword to boot;\nBut when Muspell's sons through Myrkwood ride,\nThou shalt weaponless wait, poor wretch.\"\n\n<i>Byggvir spake:</i>\n43. \"Had I birth so famous as Ingunar-Freyr,\nAnd sat in so lofty a seat,\nI would crush to marrow this croaker of ill,\nAnd beat all his body to bits.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n44. \"What little creature goes crawling there,\nSnuffling and snapping about?\nAt Freyr's ears ever wilt thou be found,\nOr muttering hard at the mill.\"\n\n<i>Byggvir spake:</i>\n45. \"Byggvir my name, and nimble am I,\nAs gods and men do grant;\nAnd here am I proud that the children of Hropt\nTogether all drink ale.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n46. \"Be silent, Byggvir! thou never couldst set\nTheir shares of the meat for men;\nHid in straw on the floor, they found thee not\nWhen heroes were fain to fight.\"\n\n<i>Heimdall spake:</i>\n47. \"Drunk art thou, Loki, and mad are thy deeds,\nWhy, Loki, leavst thou this not?\nFor drink beyond measure will lead all men\nNo thought of their tongues to take.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n48. \"Be silent, Heimdall! in days long since\nWas an evil fate for thee fixed;\nWith back held stiff must thou ever stand,\nAs warder of heaven to watch.\"\n\n<i>Skathi spake:</i>\n49. \"Light art thou, Loki, but longer thou mayst not\nIn freedom flourish thy tail;\nOn the rocks the gods bind thee with bowels torn\nForth from thy frost-cold son.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n50. \"Though on rocks the gods bind me with bowels torn\nForth from my frost-cold son,\nI was first and last at the deadly fight\nThere where Thjazi we caught.\"\n\n<i>Skathi spake:</i>\n51. \"Wert thou first and last at the deadly fight\nThere where Thjazi was caught,\nFrom my dwellings and fields shall ever come forth\nA counsel cold for thee.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n52. \"More lightly thou spakest with Laufey's son,\nWhen thou badst me come to thy bed;\nSuch things must be known if now we two\nShall seek our sins to tell.\"\n\nThen Sif came forward and poured mead for Loki in a crystal cup, and said:\n\n53. \"Hail too thee, Loki, and take thou here\nThe crystal cup of old mead;\nFor me at least, alone of the gods,\nBlameless thou knowest to be.\"\nHe took the horn, and drank therefrom:\n\n54. \"Alone thou wert if truly thou wouldst\nAll men so shyly shun;\nBut one do I know full well, methinks,\nWho had thee from Hlorrithi's arms,--\n(Loki the crafty in lies.)\"\n\n<i>Beyla spake:</i>\n55. \"The mountains shake, and surely I think\nFrom his home comes Hlorrithi now;\nHe will silence the man who is slandering here\nTogether both gods and men.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n56. \"Be silent, Beyla! thou art Byggvir's wife,\nAnd deep art thou steeped in sin;\nA greater shame to the gods came ne'er,\nBefouled thou art with thy filth.\"\n\nThen came Thor forth, and spake:\n\n57. \"Unmanly one, cease, or the mighty hammer,\nMjollnir, shall close thy mouth;\nThy shoulder-cliff shall I cleave from thy neck,\nAnd so shall thy life be lost.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n58. \"Lo, in has come the son of Earth:\nWhy threaten so loudly, Thor?\nLess fierce thou shalt go to fight with the wolf\nWhen he swallows Sigfather up.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n59. \"Unmanly one, cease, or the mighty hammer,\nMjollnir, shall close thy mouth;\nI shall hurl thee up and out in the East,\nWhere men shall see thee no more.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n60. \"That thou hast fared on the East-road forth\nTo men shouldst thou say no more;\nIn the thumb of a glove didst thou hide, thou great one,\nAnd there forgot thou wast Thor.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n61. \"Unmanly one, cease, or the mighty hammer,\nMjollnir, shall close thy mouth;\nMy right hand shall smite thee with Hrungnir's slayer,\nTill all thy bones are broken.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n62. \"Along time still do I think to live,\nThough thou threatenest thus with thy hammer;\nRough seemed the straps of Skrymir's wallet,\nWhen thy meat thou mightest not get,\n(And faint from hunger didst feel.)\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n63. \"Unmanly one, cease, or the mighty hammer,\nMjollnir, shall close thy mouth;\nThe slayer of Hrungnir shall send thee to hell,\nAnd down to the gate of death.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n64. \"'I have said to the gods and the sons of the god,\nThe things that whetted my thoughts;\nBut before thee alone do I now go forth,\nFor thou fightest well, I ween.\n\n65. \"Ale hast thou brewed, but, Ægir, now\nSuch feasts shalt thou make no more;\nO'er all that thou hast which is here within\nShall play the flickering flames,\n(And thy back shall be burnt with fire.)\"\n\nAnd after that Loki hid himself in Franang's waterfall in the guise of a salmon, and there the gods took him. He was bound with the bowels of his son Vali, but his son Narfi was changed to a wolf. Skathi took a poison-snake and fastened it up over Loki's face, and the poison dropped thereon. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat there and held a shell under the poison, but when the shell was full she bore away the poison, and meanwhile the poison dropped on Loki. Then he struggled so hard that the whole earth shook therewith; and now that is called an earthquake."
