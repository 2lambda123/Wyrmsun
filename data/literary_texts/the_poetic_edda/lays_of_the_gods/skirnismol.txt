	text = "~<The Ballad of Skirnir~>\n\nFreyr, the son of Njorth, had sat one day in Hlithskjolf, and looked over all the worlds. He looked into Jotunheim, and saw there a fair maiden, as she went from her father's house to her bower. Forthwith he felt a mighty love-sickness. Skirnir was the name of Freyr's servant; Njorth bade him ask speech of Freyr. He said:\n\n1. \"Go now, Skirnir! and seek to gain\nSpeech from my son;\nAnd answer to win, for whom the wise one\nIs mightily moved.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n2. \"Ill words do I now await from thy son,\nIf I seek to get speech with him,\nAnd answer to win, for whom the wise one\nIs mightily moved.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n3. \"Speak prithee, Freyr, foremost of the gods,\nFor now I fain would know;\nWhy sittest thou here in the wide halls,\nDays long, my prince, alone?\"\n\n<i>Freyr spake:</i>\n4. \"How shall I tell thee, thou hero young,\nOf all my grief so great?\nThough every day the elfbeam dawns,\nIt lights my longing never.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n5. \"Thy longings, methinks, are not so large\nThat thou mayst not tell them to me;\nSince in days of yore we were young together,\nWe two might each other trust.\"\n\n<i>Freyr spake:</i>\n6. \"From Gymir's house I beheld go forth\nA maiden dear to me;\nHer arms glittered, and from their gleam\nShone all the sea and sky.\n\n7. \"To me more dear than in days of old\nWas ever maiden to man;\nBut no one of gods or elves will grant\nThat we both together should be.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n8. \"Then give me the horse that goes through the dark\nAnd magic flickering flames;\nAnd the sword as well that fights of itself\nAgainst the giants grim.\"\n\n<i>Freyr spake:</i>\n9. \"The horse will I give thee that goes through the dark\nAnd magic flickering flames,\nAnd the sword as well that will fight of itself\nIf a worthy hero wields it.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake to the horse:</i>\n10. \"Dark is it without, and I deem it time\nTo fare through the wild fells,\n(To fare through the giants' fastness;)\nWe shall both come back, or us both together\nThe terrible giant will take.\"\n\nSkirnir rode into Jotunheim to Gymir's house. There were fierce dogs bound before the gate of the fence which was around Gerth's hall. He rode to where a herdsman sat on a hill, and said:\n\n11. \"Tell me, herdsman, sitting on the hill,\nAnd watching all the ways,\nHow may I win a word with the maid\nPast the hounds of Gymir here?\"\n\n<i>The herdsman spake:</i>\n12. \"Art thou doomed to die or already dead,\nThou horseman that ridest hither?\nBarred from speech shalt thou ever be\nWith Gymir's daughter good.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n13. \"Boldness is better than plaints can be\nFor him whose feet must fare;\nTo a destined day has mine age been doomed,\nAnd my life's span thereto laid.\"\n\n<i>Gerth spake:</i>\n14. \"What noise is that which now so loud\nI hear within our house?\nThe ground shakes, and the home of Gymir\nAround me trembles too.\"\n\n<i>The Serving-Maid spake:</i>\n15. \"One stands without who has leapt from his steed,\nAnd lets his horse loose to graze;\"\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n<i>Gerth spake:</i>\n16. \"Bid the man come in, and drink good mead\nHere within our hall;\nThough this I fear, that there without\nMy brother's slayer stands.\n\n17. \"Art thou of the elves or the offspring of gods,\nOr of the wise Wanes?\nHow camst thou alone through the leaping flame\nThus to behold our home?\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n18. \"I am not of the elves, nor the offspring of gods,\nNor of the wise Wanes;\nThough I came alone through the leaping flame\nThus to behold thy home.\n\n19. \"Eleven apples, all of gold,\nHere will I give thee, Gerth,\nTo buy thy troth that Freyr shall be\nDeemed to be dearest to you.\"\n\n<i>Gerth spake:</i>\n20. \"I will not take at any man's wish\nThese eleven apples ever;\nNor shall Freyr and I one dwelling find\nSo long as we two live.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n21. \"Then do I bring thee the ring that was burned\nOf old with Othin's son;\nFrom it do eight of like weight fall\nOn every ninth night.\"\n\n<i>Gerth spake:</i>\n22. \"The ring I wish not, though burned it was\nOf old with Othin's son;\nIn Gymir's home is no lack of gold\nIn the wealth my father wields.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n23. \"Seest thou, maiden, this keen, bright sword\nThat I hold here in my hand?\nThy head from thy neck shall I straightway hew,\nIf thou wilt not do my will.\"\n\n<i>Gerth spake:</i>\n24. \"For no man's sake will I ever suffer\nTo be thus moved by might;\nBut gladly, methinks, will Gymir seek\nTo fight if he finds thee here.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n25. \"Seest thou, maiden, this keen, bright sword\nThat I hold here in my hand?\nBefore its blade the old giant bends,--\nThy father is doomed to die.\n\n26. \"I strike thee, maid, with my magic staff,\nTo tame thee to work my will;\nThere shalt thou go where never again\nThe sons of men shall see thee.\n\n27. \"On the eagle's hill shalt thou ever sit,\nAnd gaze on the gates of Hel;\nMore loathsome to thee than the light-hued snake\nTo men, shall thy meat become.\n\n28. \"Fearful to see, if thou comest forth,\nHrimnir will stand and stare,\n(Men will marvel at thee;)\nMore famed shalt thou grow than the watchman of the gods!\nPeer forth, then, from thy prison,\n\n29. \"Rage and longing, fetters and wrath,\nTears and torment are thine;\nWhere thou sittest down my doom is on thee\nOf heavy heart\nAnd double dole.\n\n30. \"In the giants' home shall vile things harm thee\nEach day with evil deeds;\nGrief shalt thou get instead of gladness,\nAnd sorrow to suffer with tears.\n\n31. \"With three-headed giants thou shalt dwell ever,\nOr never know a husband;\n(Let longing grip thee, let wasting waste thee,--)\nBe like to the thistle that in the loft\nWas cast and there was crushed.\n\n32. \"I go to the wood, and to the wet forest,\nTo win a magic wand;\n. . . . . . . . . .\nI won a magic wand.\n\n33. \"Othin grows angry, angered is the best of the gods,\nFreyr shall be thy foe,\nMost evil maid, who the magic wrath\nOf gods hast got for thyself.\n\n34. \"Give heed, frost-rulers, hear it, giants.\nSons of Suttung,\nAnd gods, ye too,\nHow I forbid and how I ban\nThe meeting of men with the maid,\n(The joy of men with the maid.)\n\n35. \"Hrimgrimnir is he, the giant who shall have thee\nIn the depth by the doors of Hel;\nTo the frost-giants' halls each day shalt thou fare,\nCrawling and craving in vain,\n(Crawling and having no hope.)\n\n36. \"Base wretches there by the root of the tree\nWill hold for thee horns of filth;\nA fairer drink shalt thou never find,\nMaid, to meet thy wish,\n(Maid, to meet my wish.)\n\n37. \"I write thee a charm and three runes therewith,\nLonging and madness and lust;\nBut what I have writ I may yet unwrite\nIf I find a need therefor.\"\n\n<i>Gerth spake:</i>\n38. \"Find welcome rather, and with it take\nThe frost-cup filled with mead;\nThough I did not believe that I should so love\nEver one of the Wanes.\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spake:</i>\n39. \"My tidings all must I truly learn\nEre homeward hence I ride:\nHow soon thou wilt with the mighty son\nOf Njorth a meeting make.\"\n\n<i>Gerth spake:</i>\n40. Barri there is, which we both know well,\nA forest fair and still;\nAnd nine nights hence to the son of Njorth\nWill Gerth there grant delight.\"\n\nThen Skirnir rode home. Freyr stood without, and spoke to him, and asked for tidings:\n\n41. \"Tell me, Skirnir, ere thou take off the saddle,\nOr farest forward a step:\nWhat hast thou done in the giants' dwelling\nTo make glad thee or me?\"\n\n<i>Skirnir spoke:</i>\n42. \"Barri there is, which we both know well,\nA forest fair and still;\nAnd nine nights hence to the son of Njorth\nWill Gerth there grant delight.\"\n\n<i>Freyr spake:</i>\n43. \"Long is one night, longer are two;\nHow then shall I bear three?\nOften to me has a month seemed less\nThan now half a night of desire.\""
