	text = "~<The Ballad of Grimnir~>\n\nKing Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other Geirröth. Agnar was ten winters old, and Geirröth eight. Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for Geirröth, and taught him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with Geirröth. They had a fair wind, and came to their father's landing-place. Geirröth was forward in the boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, \"Go thou now where evil may have thee!\" The boat drifted out to sea. Geirröth, however, went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then Geirröth was made king, and became a renowned man.\n\nOthin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. Othin said: \"Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave? But Geirröth, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.\" Frigg said: \"He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come to him.\" Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about this matter. Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to Geirröth. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that King Geirröth was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself Grimnir, but said no more about himself, though he was questioned. The king had him tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there eight nights. King Geirröth had a son ten winters old, and called Agnar after his father's brother. Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented with out cause. Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on Grimnir's back. He spake:\n\n1. Hot art thou, fire! too fierce by far;\nGet ye now gone, ye flames!\nThe mantle is burnt, though I bear it aloft,\nAnd the fire scorches the fur.\n\n2. 'Twixt the fires now eight nights have I sat,\nAnd no man brought meat to me,\nSave Agnar alone, and alone shall rule\nGeirröth's son o'er the Goths.\n\n3. Hail to thee, Agnar! for hailed thou art\nBy the voice of Veratyr;\nFor a single drink shalt thou never receive\nA greater gift as reward.\n\n4. The land is holy that lies hard by\nThe gods and the elves together;\nAnd Thor shall ever in Thruthheim dwell,\nTill the gods to destruction go.\n\n5. Ydalir call they the place where Ull\nA hall for himself hath set;\nAnd Alfheim the gods to Freyr once gave\nAs a tooth-gift in ancient times.\n\n6. A third home is there, with silver thatched\nBy the hands of the gracious gods:\nValaskjolf is it, in days of old\nSet by a god for himself.\n\n7. Sökkvabekk is the fourth, where cool waves flow,\nAnd amid their murmur it stands;\nThere daily do Othin and Saga drink\nIn gladness from cups of gold.\n\n8. The fifth is Glathsheim, and gold-bright there\nStands Valhall stretching wide;\nAnd there does Othin each day choose\nThe men who have fallen in fight.\n\n9. Easy is it to know for him who to Othin\nComes and beholds the hall;\nIts rafters are spears, with shields is it roofed,\nOn its benches are breastplates strewn.\n\n10. Easy is it to know for him who to Othin\nComes and beholds the hall;\nThere hangs a wolf by the western door,\nAnd o'er it an eagle hovers.\n\n11. The sixth is Thrymheim, where Thjazi dwelt,\nThe giant of marvelous might;\nNow Skathi abides, the god's fair bride,\nIn the home that her father had.\n\n12. The seventh is Breithablik; Baldr has there\nFor himself a dwelling set,\nIn the land I know that lies so fair,\nAnd from evil fate is free.\n\n13. Himinbjorg is the eighth, and Heimdall there\nO'er men holds sway, it is said;\nIn his well-built house does the warder of heaven\nThe good mead gladly drink.\n\n14. The ninth is Folkvang, where Freyja decrees\nWho shall have seats in the hall; The half of the dead each day does she choose, And half does Othin have.\n\n15. The tenth is Glitnir; its pillars are gold, And its roof with silver is set; There most of his days does Forseti dwell, And sets all strife at end.\n\n16. The eleventh is Noatun; there has Njorth For himself a dwelling set; The sinless ruler of men there sits In his temple timbered high.\n\n17. Filled with growing trees and high-standing grass Is Vithi, Vithar's land;\nBut there did the son from his steed leap down,\nWhen his father he fain would avenge.\n\n18. In Eldhrimnir Andhrimnir cooks\nSæhrimnir's seething flesh,--\nThe best of food, but few men know\nOn what fare the warriors feast.\n\n19. Freki and Geri does Heerfather feed,\nThe far-famed fighter of old:\nBut on wine alone does the weapon-decked god,\nOthin, forever live.\n\n20. O'er Mithgarth Hugin and Munin both\nEach day set forth to fly;\nFor Hugin I fear lest he come not home,\nBut for Munin my care is more.\n\n21. Loud roars Thund, and Thjothvitnir's fish\njoyously fares in the flood;\nHard does it seem to the host of the slain\nTo wade the torrent wild.\n\n22. There Valgrind stands, the sacred gate,\nAnd behind are the holy doors;\nOld is the gate, but few there are\nWho can tell how it tightly is locked.\n\n23. Five hundred doors and forty there are,\nI ween, in Valhall's walls;\nEight hundred fighters through one door fare\nWhen to war with the wolf they go.\n\n24. Five hundred rooms and forty there are\nI ween, in Bilskirnir built;\nOf all the homes whose roofs I beheld,\nMy son's the greatest meseemed.\n\n25. Heithrun is the goat who stands by Heerfather's hall,\nAnd the branches of Lærath she bites;\nThe pitcher she fills with the fair, clear mead,\nNe'er fails the foaming drink.\n\n26. Eikthyrnir is the hart who stands by Heerfather's hall\nAnd the branches of Lærath he bites;\nFrom his horns a stream into Hvergelmir drops,\nThence all the rivers run.\n\n27. Sith and Vith, Sækin and Ækin,\nSvol and Fimbulthul, Gunnthro, and Fjorm,\nRin and Rinnandi,\nGipul and Gopul, Gomul and Geirvimul,\nThat flow through the fields of the gods;\nThyn and Vin, Thol and Hol,\nGroth and Gunnthorin.\n\n28. Vino is one, Vegsvin another,\nAnd Thjothnuma a third;\nNyt and Not, Non and Hron,\nSlith and Hrith, Sylg and Ylg,\nVith and Von, Vond and Strond,\nGjol and Leipt, that go among men,\nAnd hence they fall to Hel.\n\n29. Kormt and Ormt and the Kerlaugs twain\nShall Thor each day wade through,\n(When dooms to give he forth shall go\nTo the ash-tree Yggdrasil;)\nFor heaven's bridge burns all in flame,\nAnd the sacred waters seethe.\n\n30. Glath and Gyllir, Gler and Skeithbrimir,\nSilfrintopp and Sinir,\nGisl and Falhofnir, Golltopp and Lettfeti,\nOn these steeds the gods shall go\nWhen dooms to give each day they ride\nTo the ash-tree Yggdrasil.\n\n31. Three roots there are that three ways run\n'Neath the ash-tree Yggdrasil;\n'Neath the first lives Hel, 'neath the second the frost-giants,\n'Neath the last are the lands of men.\n\n32. Ratatosk is the squirrel who there shall run\nOn the ash-tree Yggdrasil;\nFrom above the words of the eagle he bears,\nAnd tells them to Nithhogg beneath.\n\n33. Four harts there are, that the highest twigs\nNibble with necks bent back;\nDain and Dvalin, . . . . . .\nDuneyr and Dyrathror.\n\n34. More serpents there are beneath the ash\nThan an unwise ape would think;\nGoin and Moin, Grafvitnir's sons,\nGrabak and Grafvolluth,\nOfnir and Svafnir shall ever, methinks,\nGnaw at the twigs of the tree.\n\n35. Yggdrasil's ash great evil suffers,\nFar more than men do know;\nThe hart bites its top, its trunk is rotting,\nAnd Nithhogg gnaws beneath.\n\n36. Hrist and Mist bring the horn at my will,\nSkeggjold and Skogul;\nHild and Thruth, Hlok and Herfjotur,\nGol and Geironul,\nRandgrith and Rathgrith and Reginleif\nBeer to the warriors bring.\n\n37. Arvak and Alsvith up shall drag\nWeary the weight of the sun;\nBut an iron cool have the kindly gods\nOf yore set under their yokes.\n\n38. In front of the sun does Svalin stand,\nThe shield for the shining god;\nMountains and sea would be set in flames\nIf it fell from before the sun.\n\n39. Skoll is the wolf that to Ironwood\nFollows the glittering god,\nAnd the son of Hrothvitnir, Hati, awaits\nThe burning bride of heaven.\n\n40. Out of Ymir's flesh was fashioned the earth,\nAnd the ocean out of his blood;\nOf his bones the hills, of his hair the trees,\nOf his skull the heavens high.\n\n41. Mithgarth the gods from his eyebrows made,\nAnd set for the sons of men;\nAnd out of his brain the baleful clouds\nThey made to move on high.\n\n42. His the favor of Ull and of all the gods\nWho first in the flames will reach;\nFor the house can be seen by the sons of the gods\nIf the kettle aside were cast.\n\n43. In days of old did Ivaldi's sons\nSkithblathnir fashion fair,\nThe best of ships for the bright god Freyr,\nThe noble son of Njorth.\n\n44. The best of trees must Yggdrasil be,\nSkithblathnir best of boats;\nOf all the gods is Othin the greatest,\nAnd Sleipnir the best of steeds;\nBifrost of bridges, Bragi of skalds,\nHobrok of hawks, and Garm of hounds.\n\n45. To the race of the gods my face have I raised,\nAnd the wished-for aid have I waked;\nFor to all the gods has the message gone\nThat sit in Ægir's seats,\nThat drink within Ægir's doors.\n\n46. Grim is my name, Gangleri am I,\nHerjan and Hjalmberi,\nThekk and Thrithi, Thuth and Uth,\nHelblindi and Hor;\n\n47. Sath and Svipal and Sanngetal,\nHerteit and Hnikar,\nBileyg, Baleyg, Bolverk, Fjolnir,\nGrim and Grimnir, Glapsvith, Fjolsvith.\n\n48. Sithhott, Sithskegg, Sigfather, Hnikuth,\nAllfather, Valfather, Atrith, Farmatyr:\nA single name have I never had\nSince first among men I fared.\n\n49. Grimnir they call me in Geirröth's hall,\nWith Asmund Jalk am I;\nKjalar I was when I went in a sledge,\nAt the council Thror am I called,\nAs Vithur I fare to the fight;\nOski, Biflindi, Jafnhor and Omi,\nGondlir and Harbarth midst gods.\nSo. I deceived the giant Sokkmimir old\nAs Svithur and Svithrir of yore;\nOf Mithvitnir's son the slayer I was\nWhen the famed one found his doom.\n\n51. Drunk art thou, Geirröth, too much didst thou drink,\n. . . . . . . . . .\nMuch hast thou lost, for help no more\nFrom me or my heroes thou hast.\n\n52. Small heed didst thou take to all that I told,\nAnd false were the words of thy friends;\nFor now the sword of my friend I see,\nThat waits all wet with blood.\n\n53. Thy sword-pierced body shall Ygg have soon,\nFor thy life is ended at last;\nThe maids are hostile; now Othin behold!\nNow come to me if thou canst!\n\n54. Now am I Othin, Ygg was I once,\nEre that did they call me Thund;\nVak and Skilfing, Vofuth and Hroptatyr,\nGaut and Jalk midst the gods;\nOfnir and Svafnir, and all, methinks,\nAre names for none but me.\n\nKing Geirröth sat and had his sword on his knee, half drawn from its sheath. But when he heard that Othin was come thither, then he rose up and sought to take Othin from the fire. The sword slipped from his hand, and fell with the hilt down. The king stumbled and fell forward, and the sword pierced him through, and slew him. Then Othin vanished, but Agnar long ruled there as king."
