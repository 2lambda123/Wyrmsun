		text = "[i]The[/i] [i]Lay[/i] [i]of[/i] [i]Thrym[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe [i]Thrymskvitha[/i] is found only in the [i]Codex[/i] [i]Regius[/i], where it follows the [i]Lokasenna[/i]. Snorri does not quote from it, nor, rather oddly, does the story occur in the [i]Prose[/i] [i]Edda[/i].\n\nArtistically the [i]Thrymskvitha[/i] is one of the best, as it is, next to the [i]Voluspo[/i], the most famous, of the entire collection. It has, indeed, been called \"the finest ballad in the world,\" and not without some reason. Its swift, vigorous action, the sharpness of its characterization and the humor of the central situation combine to make it one of the most vivid short narrative poems ever composed. Of course we know nothing specific of its author, but there can be no question that he was a poet of extraordinary ability. The poem assumed its present form, most critics agree, somewhere about 900, and thus it is one of the oldest in the collection. It has been suggested, on the basis of stylistic similarity, that its author may also have composed the [i]Skirnismol[/i], and possibly [i]Baldrs[/i] [i]Draumar[/i]. There is also some resemblance between the [i]Thrymskvitha[/i] and the [i]Lokasenna[/i] (note, in this connection, Bugge's suggestion that the [i]Skirnismol[/i] and the [i]Lokasenna[/i] may have been by the same man), and it is not impossible that all four poems have a single authorship.\n\nThe [i]Thrymskvitha[/i] has been preserved in excellent condition, without any serious gaps or interpolations. In striking contrast to many of the poems, it contains no prose narrative links, the story being told in narrative verse--a rare phenomenon in the poems of the [i]Edda[/i].\n\n1. Wild was Vingthor | when he awoke,\nAnd when his mighty | hammer he missed;\n\n[1. [i]Vingthor[/i] (\"Thor the Hurler\"): another name for Thor, equivalent to Vingnir ([i]Vafthruthnismol[/i], 51). Concerning Thor and his hammer, Mjollnir, cf. [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], [i]Lokasenna[/i], and [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], [i]passim[/i]. [i]Jorth[/i]: Earth, Thor's mother, Othin being his father.]"

[i]Feather-dress[/i]: this flying equipment of Freyja's is also used in the story of Thjazi, wherein Loki again borrows the \"hawk's dress\" of Freyja, this time to rescue Ithun; cf. [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 19 and note.\n\n4. The manuscript and most editions have lines 1-2 in inverse order. Several editors assume a lacuna before line I, making a stanza out of the two conjectural lines (Bugge actually supplies them) and lines 1-2 of stanza 4. Thus they either make a separate stanza out of lines 3-5 or unite them in a six-line stanza with 5. The manuscript punctuation and capitalization--not]"

The manuscript marks line 2, instead of line I, as the beginning of a stanza, which has caused editors some confusion in grouping the lines of stanzas 8 and 9.\n\n10. No superscription in the manuscript.\n\n12. Many editors have rejected either line 2 or line s. Vigfusson inserts one of his own lines before line 4.

[i]Heimdall[/i]: the phrase \"whitest of the gods\" suggests that Heimdall was the god of light as well as being the watchman. His wisdom was probably connected with his sleepless watching over all the worlds; cf. Lokasenna, 47 and note. On the Wanes Cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 21 and note.

The stanza division is thus arbitrary; some editors have made one stanza of the six lines, others have combined the last two lines of stanza 19 with stanza 20. It is possible that a couple of lines have been lost.\n\n21. [i]Goats[/i]: Thor's wagon was always drawn by goats; cf. [i]Hymiskvitha[/i], 38 and note.

[i]Hymiskvitha[/i], 38, note) the god \"hallows\" the goat with his hammer. One of the oldest runic signs, sup posed to have magic power, was named Thor's-hammer. [i]Vor[/i]: the goddess of vows, particularly between men and women; Snorri lists a number of little-known goddesses similar to Vor, all of them apparently little more than names for Frigg.\n\n33. Some editors reject this line, which, from a dramatic stand point, is certainly a pity. In the manuscript it begins with a capital letter, like: the opening of a new stanza.]"
