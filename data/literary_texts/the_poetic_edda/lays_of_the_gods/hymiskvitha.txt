	text = "~<The Lay of Hymir~>\n\n1. Of old the gods made feast together,\nAnd drink they sought ere sated they were;\nTwigs they shook, and blood they tried:\nRich fare in Ægir's hall they found.\n\n2. The mountain-dweller sat merry as boyhood,\nBut soon like a blinded man he seemed;\nThe son of Ygg gazed in his eyes:\n\"For the gods a feast shalt thou forthwith get.\"\n\n3. The word-wielder toil for the giant worked,\nAnd so revenge on the gods he sought;\nHe bade Sif's mate the kettle bring:\n\"Therein for ye all much ale shall I brew.\"\n\n4. The far-famed ones could find it not,\nAnd the holy gods could get it nowhere;\nTill in truthful wise did Tyr speak forth,\nAnd helpful counsel to Hlorrithi gave.\n\n5. \"There dwells to the east of Elivagar\nHymir the wise at the end of heaven;\nA kettle my father fierce doth own,\nA mighty vessel a mile in depth.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n6. \"May we win, dost thou think, this whirler of water?\"\n\n<i>Tyr spake:</i>\n\"Aye, friend, we can, if cunning we are.\"\n\n7. Forward that day with speed they fared,\nFrom Asgarth came they to Egil's home;\nThe goats with horns bedecked he guarded;\nThen they sped to the hall where Hymir dwelt.\n\n8. The youth found his grandam, that greatly he loathed,\nAnd full nine hundred heads she had;\nBut the other fair with gold came forth,\nAnd the bright-browed one brought beer to her son.\n\n9. \"Kinsman of giants, beneath the kettle\nWill I set ye both, ye heroes bold;\nFor many a time my dear-loved mate\nTo guests is wrathful and grim of mind.\"\n\n10. Late to his home the misshapen Hymir,\nThe giant harsh, from his hunting came;\nThe icicles rattled as in he came,\nFor the fellow's chin-forest frozen was.\n\n11. \"Hail to thee, Hymir! good thoughts mayst thou have;\nHere has thy son to thine hall now come;\n(For him have we waited, his way was long;)\nAnd with him fares the foeman of Hroth,\nThe friend of mankind, and Veur they call him.\n\n12. \"See where under the gable they sit!\nBehind the beam do they hide themselves.\"\nThe beam at the glance of the giant broke,\nAnd the mighty pillar in pieces fell.\n\n13. Eight fell from the ledge, and one alone,\nThe hard-hammered kettle, of all was whole;\nForth came they then, and his foes he sought,\nThe giant old, and held with his eyes.\n\n14. Much sorrow his heart foretold when he saw\nThe giantess' foeman come forth on the floor;\nThen of the steers did they bring in three;\nTheir flesh to boil did the giant bid.\n\n15. By a head was each the shorter hewed,\nAnd the beasts to the fire straight they bore;\nThe husband of Sif, ere to sleep he went,\nAlone two oxen of Hymir's ate.\n\n16. To the comrade hoary of Hrungnir then\nDid Hlorrithi's meal full mighty seem;\n\"Next time at eve we three must eat\nThe food we have {illegible}s the hunting's spoil.\"\n\n17. . . . . . . . . . .\nFain to row on the sea was Veur, he said,\nIf the giant bold would give him bait.\n\n<i>Hymir spake:</i>\n18. \"Go to the herd, if thou hast it in mind,\nThou slayer of giants, thy bait to seek;\nFor there thou soon mayst find, methinks,\nBait from the oxen easy to get.\"\n\n19. Swift to the wood the hero went,\nTill before him an ox all black he found;\nFrom the beast the slayer of giants broke\nThe fortress high of his double horns.\n\n<i>Hymir spake:</i>\n20. \"Thy works, methinks, are worse by far,\nThou steerer of ships, than when still thou sittest.\"\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n21. The lord of the goats bade the ape-begotten\nFarther to steer the steed of the rollers;\nBut the giant said that his will, forsooth,\nLonger to row was little enough.\n\n22. Two whales on his hook did the mighty Hymir\nSoon pull up on a single cast;\nIn the stern the kinsman of Othin sat,\nAnd Veur with cunning his cast prepared.\n\n23. The warder of men, the worm's destroyer,\nFixed on his hook the head of the ox;\nThere gaped at the bait the foe of the gods,\nThe girdler of all the earth beneath.\n\n24. The venomous serpent swiftly up\nTo the boat did Thor, the bold one, pull;\nWith his hammer the loathly hill of the hair\nOf the brother of Fenrir he smote from above.\n\n25. The monsters roared, and the rocks resounded,\nAnd all the earth so old was shaken;\n. . . . . . . . . .\nThen sank the fish in the sea forthwith.\n\n26. . . . . . . . . . .\nJoyless as back they rowed was the giant;\nSpeechless did Hymir sit at the oars,\nWith the rudder he sought a second wind.\n\n<i>Hymir spake:</i>\n27. \"The half of our toil wilt thou have with me,\nAnd now make fast our goat of the flood;\nOr home wilt thou bear the whales to the house,\nAcross the gorge of the wooded glen?\"\n\n28. Hlorrithi stood and the stem he gripped,\nAnd the sea-horse with water awash he lifted;\nOars and bailer and all he bore\nWith the surf-swine home to the giant's house.\n\n29. His might the giant again would match,\nFor stubborn he was, with the strength of Thor;\nNone truly strong, though stoutly he rowed,\nWould he call save one who could break the cup.\n\n30. Hlorrithi then, when the cup he held,\nStruck with the glass the pillars of stone;\nAs he sat the posts in pieces he shattered,\nYet the glass to Hymir whole they brought.\n\n31. But the loved one fair of the giant found\nA counsel true, and told her thought:\n\"Smite the skull of Hymir, heavy with food,\nFor harder it is than ever was glass.\"\n\n32. The goats' mighty ruler then rose on his knee,\nAnd with all the strength of a god he struck;\nWhole was the fellow's helmet-stem,\nBut shattered the wine-cup rounded was.\n\n<i>Hymir spake:</i>\n33. \"Fair is the treasure that from me is gone,\nSince now the cup on my knees lies shattered;\"\nSo spake the giant: \"No more can I say\nIn days to be, 'Thou art brewed, mine ale.'\n\n34. \"Enough shall it be if out ye can bring\nForth from our house the kettle here.\"\nTyr then twice to move it tried,\nBut before him the kettle twice stood fast.\n\n35. The father of Mothi the rim seized firm,\nAnd before it stood on the floor below;\nUp on his head Sif's husband raised it,\nAnd about his heels the handles clattered.\n\n36. Not long had they fared, ere backwards looked\nThe son of Othin, once more to see;\nFrom their caves in the east beheld he coming\nWith Hymir the throng of the many-headed.\n\n37. He stood and cast from his back the kettle,\nAnd Mjollnir, the lover of murder, he wielded;\n. . . . . . . . . .\nSo all the whales of the waste he slew.\n\n38. Not long had they fared ere one there lay\nOf Hlorrithi's goats half-dead on the ground;\nIn his leg the pole-horse there was lame;\nThe deed the evil Loki had done.\n\n39. But ye all have heard,-- for of them who have\nThe tales of the gods, who better can tell?\nWhat prize he won from the wilderness-dweller,\nWho both his children gave him to boot.\n\n40. The mighty one came to the council of gods,\nAnd the kettle he had that Hymir's was;\nSo gladly their ale the gods could drink\nIn Ægir's hall at the autumn-time."
