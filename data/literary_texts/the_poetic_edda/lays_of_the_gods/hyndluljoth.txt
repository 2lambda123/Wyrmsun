	text = "~<The Poem of Hyndla~>\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n1. \"Maiden, awake! wake thee, my friend,\nMy sister Hyndla, in thy hollow cave!\nAlready comes darkness, and ride must we\nTo Valhall to seek the sacred hall.\n\n2. \"The favor of Heerfather seek we to find,\nTo his followers gold he gladly gives;\nTo Hermoth gave he helm and mail-coat,\nAnd to Sigmund he gave a sword as gift.\n\n3. \"Triumph to some, and treasure to others,\nTo many wisdom and skill in words,\nFair winds to the sailor, to the singer his art,\nAnd a manly heart to many a hero.\n\n4. \"Thor shall I honor, and this shall I ask,\nThat his favor true mayst thou ever find;\n. . . . . . . . . .\nThough little the brides of the giants he loves.\n\n5. \"From the stall now one of thy wolves lead forth,\nAnd along with my boar shalt thou let him run;\nFor slow my boar goes on the road of the gods,\nAnd I would not weary my worthy steed.\"\n\n<i>Hyndla spake:</i>\n6. \"Falsely thou askest me, Freyja, to go,\nFor so in the glance of thine eyes I see;\nOn the way of the slain thy lover goes with thee.\nOttar the young, the son of Instein.\"\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n7. \"Wild dreams, methinks, are thine when thou sayest\nMy lover is with me on the way of the slain;\nThere shines the boar with bristles of gold,\nHildisvini, he who was made\nBy Dain and Nabbi, the cunning dwarfs.\n\n8. \"Now let us down from our saddles leap,\nAnd talk of the race of the heroes twain;\nThe men who were born of the gods above,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n9. \"A wager have made in the foreign metal\nOttar the young and Angantyr;\nWe must guard, for the hero young to have,\nHis father's wealth, the fruits of his race.\n\n10. \"For me a shrine of stones he made,--\nAnd now to glass the rock has grown;--\nOft with the blood of beasts was it red;\nIn the goddesses ever did Ottar trust.\n\n11. \"Tell to me now the ancient names,\nAnd the races of all that were born of old:\nWho are of the Skjoldungs, who of the Skilfings,\nWho of the Othlings, who of the Ylfings,\nWho are the free-born, who are the high-born,\nThe noblest of men that in Mithgarth dwell?\"\n\n<i>Hyndla spake:</i>\n12. \"Thou art, Ottar, the son of Instein,\nAnd Instein the son of Alf the Old,\nAlf of Ulf, Ulf of Sæfari,\nAnd Sæfari's father was Svan the Red.\n\n13. \"Thy mother, bright with bracelets fair,\nHight, methinks, the priestess Hledis;\nFrothi her father, and Friaut her mother;--\nHer race of the mightiest men must seem.\n\n14. \"Of old the noblest of all was Ali,\nBefore him Halfdan, foremost of Skjoldungs;\nFamed were the battles the hero fought,\nTo the corners of heaven his deeds were carried.\n\n15. \"Strengthened by Eymund, the strongest of men,\nSigtrygg he slew with the ice-cold sword;\nHis bride was Almveig, the best of women,\nAnd eighteen boys did Almveig bear him.\n\n16. \"Hence come the Skjoldungs, hence the Skilfings,\nHence the Othlings, hence the Ynglings,\nHence come the free-born, hence the high-born,\nThe noblest of men that in Mithgarth dwell:\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\n\n17. \"Hildigun then her mother hight,\nThe daughter of Svava and Sækonung;\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\nIt is much to know,-- wilt thou hear yet more?\n\n18. \"The mate of Dag was a mother of heroes,\nThora, who bore him the bravest of fighters,\nFrathmar and Gyrth and the Frekis twain,\nAm and Jofurmar, Alf the Old;\nIt is much to know,-- wilt thou hear yet more?\n\n19. \"Her husband was Ketil, the heir of Klypp,\nHe was of thy mother the mother's-father;\nBefore the days of Kari was Frothi,\nAnd horn of Hild was Hoalf then.\n\n20. \"Next was Nanna, daughter of Nokkvi,\nThy father's kinsman her son became;\nOld is the line, and longer still,\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\n\n21. \"Isolf and Osolf, the sons of Olmoth,\nWhose wife was Skurhild, the daughter of Skekkil,\nCount them among the heroes mighty,\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\n\n22. \"Gunnar the Bulwark, Grim the Hardy,\nThorir the Iron-shield, Ulf the Gaper,\nBrodd and Hörvir both did I know;\nIn the household they were of Hrolf the Old.\n\n23. \"Hervarth, Hjorvarth, Hrani, Angantyr,\nBui and Brami, Barri and Reifnir,\nTind and Tyrfing, the Haddings twain,--\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\n\n24. \"Eastward in Bolm were born of old\nThe sons of Arngrim and Eyfura;\nWith berserk-tumult and baleful deed\nLike fire o'er land and sea they fared,\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\n\n25. \"The sons of Jormunrek all of yore\nTo the gods in death were as offerings given;\nHe was kinsman of Sigurth,-- hear well what I say,--\nThe foe of hosts, and Fafnir's slayer.\n\n26., \"From Volsung's seed was the hero sprung,\nAnd Hjordis was born of Hrauthung's race,\nAnd Eylimi from the Othlings came,--\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\n\n27. \"Gunnar and Hogni, the heirs of Gjuki,\nAnd Guthrun as well, who their sister was;\nBut Gotthorm was not of Gjuki's race,\nAlthough the brother of both he was:\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\n\n28. \"Of Hvethna's sons was Haki the best,\nAnd Hjorvarth the father of Hvethna was;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n29. \"Harald Battle-tooth of Auth was born,\nHrörek the Ring-giver her husband was;\nAuth the Deep-minded was Ivar's daughter,\nBut Rathbarth the father of Randver was:\nAnd all are thy kinsmen, Ottar, thou fool!\"\n\n* * *\n\n<i>Fragment of \"The Short Voluspo\"</i>\n\n30. Eleven in number the gods were known,\nWhen Baldr o'er the hill of death was bowed;\nAnd this to avenge was Vali swift,\nWhen his brother's slayer soon he slew.\n\n31. The father of Baldr was the heir of Bur,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n32. Freyr's wife was Gerth, the daughter of Gymir,\nOf the giants' brood, and Aurbotha bore her;\nTo these as well was Thjazi kin,\nThe dark-loving giant; his daughter was Skathi.\n\n33. Much have I told thee, and further will tell;\nThere is much that I know;-- wilt thou hear yet more?\n\n34. Heith and Hrossthjof, the children of Hrimnir.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n35. The sybils arose from Vitholf's race,\nFrom Vilmeith all the seers are,\nAnd the workers of charms are Svarthofthi's children,\nAnd from Ymir sprang the giants all.\n\n36. Much have I told thee, and further will tell;\nThere is much that I know;-- wilt thou hear yet more?\n\n37. One there was born in the bygone days,\nOf the race of the gods, and great was his might;\nNine giant women, at the world's edge,\nOnce bore the man so mighty in arms.\n\n38. Gjolp there bore him, Greip there bore him,\nEistla bore him, and Eyrgjafa,\nUlfrun bore him, and Angeyja,\nImth and Atla, and Jarnsaxa.\n\n39. Strong was he made with the strength of earth,\nWith the ice-cold sea, and the blood of swine.\n\n40. One there was born, the best of all,\nAnd strong was he made with the strength of earth;\nThe proudest is called the kinsman of men\nOf the rulers all throughout the world.\n\n41. Much have I told thee, and further will tell;\nThere is much that I know;-- wilt thou hear yet more?\n\n42. The wolf did Loki with Angrbotha win,\nAnd Sleipnir bore he to Svathilfari;\nThe worst of marvels seemed the one\nThat sprang from the brother of Byleist then.\n\n43. A heart ate Loki,-- in the embers it lay,\nAnd half-cooked found he the woman's heart;--\nWith child from the woman Lopt soon was,\nAnd thence among men came the monsters all.\n\n44. The sea, storm-driven, seeks heaven itself,\nO'er the earth it flows, the air grows sterile;\nThen follow the snows and the furious winds,\nFor the gods are doomed, and the end is death.\n\n45. Then comes another, a greater than all,\nThough never I dare his name to speak;\nFew are they now that farther can see\nThan the moment when Othin shall meet the wolf.\n\n* * *\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n46. \"To my boar now bring the memory-beer,\nSo that all thy words, that well thou hast spoken,\nThe third morn hence he may hold in mind,\nWhen their races Ottar and Angantyr tell.\"\n\n<i>Hyndla spake:</i>\n47. \"Hence shalt thou fare, for fain would I sleep,\nFrom me thou gettest few favors good;\nMy noble one, out in the night thou leapest\nAs Heithrun goes the goats among.\n\n48. \"To Oth didst thou run, who loved thee ever,\nAnd many under thy apron have crawled;\nMy noble one, out in the night thou leapest,\nAs Heithrun goes the goats among.\"\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n49. \"Around the giantess flames shall I raise,\nSo that forth unburned thou mayst not fare.\"\n\n<i>Hyndla spake:</i>\n50. \"Flames I see burning, the earth is on fire,\nAnd each for his life the price must lose;\nBring then to Ottar the draught of beer,\nOf venom full for an evil fate.\"\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n51. \"Thine evil words shall work no ill,\nThough, giantess, bitter thy baleful threats;\nA drink full fair shall Ottar find,\nIf of all the gods the favor I get.\""
