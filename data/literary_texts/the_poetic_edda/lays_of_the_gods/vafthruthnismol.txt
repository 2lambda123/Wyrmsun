The wisdom then of the giant wise\nForth did he fare to try;\nHe found the hall of the father of Im,\nAnd in forthwith went Ygg.\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n6. \"Vafthruthnir, hail! to thy hall am I come,\nFor thyself I fain would see;\nAnd first would I ask if wise thou art,\nOr, giant, all wisdom hast won.\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n7. \"Who is the man that speaks to me,\nHere in my lofty hall?\nForth from our dwelling thou never shalt fare,\nUnless wiser than I thou art.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n8. \"Gagnrath they call me, and thirsty I come\nFrom a journey hard to thy hall;\nWelcome I look for, for long have I fared,\nAnd gentle greeting, giant.\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n9. \"Why standest thou there on the floor whilst thou speakest?\nA seat shalt thou have in my hall;\nThen soon shall we know whose knowledge is more,\nThe guest's or the sage's gray.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n10. \"If a poor man reaches the home of the rich,\nLet him wisely speak or be still;\nFor to him who speaks with the hard of heart\nWill chattering ever work ill.\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n11. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, if there from the floor\nThou wouldst thy wisdom make known:\nWhat name has the steed that each morn anew\nThe day for mankind doth draw?\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n12. \"Skinfaxi is he, the steed who for men\nThe glittering day doth draw;\nThe best of horses to heroes he seems,\nAnd brightly his mane doth burn.\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n13. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, if there from the floor\nThou wouldst thy wisdom make known:\nWhat name has the steed that from East anew\nBrings night for the noble gods?\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n14. \"Hrimfaxi name they the steed that anew\nBrings night for the noble gods;\nEach morning foam from his bit there falls,\nAnd thence come the dews in the dales.\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n15. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, if there from the floor\nThou wouldst thy wisdom make known:\nWhat name has the river that 'twixt the realms\nOf the gods and the giants goes?\"\n\n<i>Othin spoke:</i>\n16. \"Ifing is the river that 'twixt the realms\nOf the gods and the giants goes;\nFor all time ever open it flows,\nNo ice on the river there is.\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n17. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, if there from the floor\nThou wouldst thy wisdom make known:\nWhat name has the field where in fight shall meet\nSurt and the gracious gods?\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n18. \"Vigrith is the field where in fight shall meet\nSurt and the gracious gods;\nA hundred miles each way does it measure.\nAnd so are its boundaries set.\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n19. \"Wise art thou, guest! To my bench shalt thou go,\nIn our seats let us speak together;\nHere in the hall our heads, O guest,\nShall we wager our wisdom upon.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n20. \"First answer me well, if thy wisdom avails,\nAnd thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nIn earliest time whence came the earth,\nOr the sky, thou giant sage?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n21. \"Out of Ymir's flesh was fashioned the earth,\nAnd the mountains were made of his bones;\nThe sky from the frost-cold giant's skull,\nAnd the ocean out of his blood.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n22. \"Next answer me well, if thy wisdom avails,\nAnd thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nWhence came the moon, o'er the world of men\nThat fares, and the flaming sun?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n23. \"Mundilferi is he who begat the moon,\nAnd fathered the flaming sun;\nThe round of heaven each day they run,\nTo tell the time for men.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n24. \"Third answer me well, if wise thou art called,\nIf thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nWhence came the day, o'er mankind that fares,\nOr night with the narrowing moon?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n25. \"The father of day is Delling called,\nAnd the night was begotten by Nor;\nFull moon and old by the gods were fashioned,\nTo tell the time for men.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n26. \"Fourth answer me well, if wise thou art called,\nIf thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nWhence did winter come, or the summer warm,\nFirst with the gracious gods?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n27. \"Vindsval he was who was winter's father,\nAnd Svosuth summer begat;\"\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n28. \"Fifth answer me well, if wise thou art called,\nIf thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nWhat giant first was fashioned of old,\nAnd the eldest of Ymir's kin?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n29. \"Winters unmeasured ere earth was made\nWas the birth of Bergelmir;\nThruthgelmir's son was the giant strong,\nAnd Aurgelmir's grandson of old.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n30. \"Sixth answer me well, if wise thou art called,\nIf thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nWhence did Aurgelmir come with the giants' kin,\nLong since, thou giant sage?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n31. \"Down from Elivagar did venom drop,\nAnd waxed till a giant it was;\nAnd thence arose our giants' race,\nAnd thus so fierce are we found.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n32. \"Seventh answer me well, if wise thou art called,\nIf thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nHow begat he children, the giant grim,\nWho never a giantess knew?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n33. \"They say 'neath the arms of the giant of ice\nGrew man-child and maid together;\nAnd foot with foot did the wise one fashion\nA son that six heads bore.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n34. \"Eighth answer me well, if wise thou art called,\nIf thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nWhat farthest back dost thou bear in mind?\nFor wide is thy wisdom, giant!\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n35. \"Winters unmeasured ere earth was made\nWas the birth of Bergelmir;\nThis first knew I well, when the giant wise\nIn a boat of old was borne.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n36. \"Ninth answer me well, if wise thou art called\nIf thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:\nWhence comes the wind that fares o'er the waves\nYet never itself is seen?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n37. \"In an eagle's guise at the end of heaven\nHr√¶svelg sits, they say;\nAnd from his wings does the wind come forth\nTo move o'er the world of men.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n38. \"Tenth answer me now, if thou knowest all\nThe fate that is fixed for the gods:\nWhence came up Njorth to the kin of the gods,--\n(Rich in temples and shrines he rules,--)\nThough of gods he was never begot?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n39. \"In the home of the Wanes did the wise ones create him,\nAnd gave him as pledge to the gods;\nAt the fall of the world shall he fare once more\nHome to the Wanes so wise.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n40. \"Eleventh answer me well, . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . .\nWhat men . . . . . . in . . . . . . home\nEach day to fight go forth?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n41. \"The heroes all in Othin's hall\nEach day to fight go forth;\nThey fell each other, and fare from the fight\nAll healed full soon to sit.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n42. \"Twelfth answer me now how all thou knowest\nOf the fate that is fixed for the gods;\nOf the runes of the gods and the giants' race\nThe truth indeed dost thou tell,\n(And wide is thy wisdom, giant!)\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n43. \"Of the runes of the gods and the giants' race\nThe truth indeed can I tell,\n(For to every world have I won;)\nTo nine worlds came I, to Niflhel beneath,\nThe home where dead men dwell.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n44. \"Much have I fared, much have I found,\nMuch have I got of the gods:\nWhat shall live of mankind when at last there comes\nThe mighty winter to men?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n45. \"In Hoddmimir's wood shall hide themselves\nLif and Lifthrasir then;\nThe morning dews for meat shall they have,\nSuch food shall men then find.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n46. \"Much have I fared, much have I found,\nMuch have I got of the gods:\nWhence comes the sun to the smooth sky back,\nWhen Fenrir has snatched it forth?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n47. \"A daughter bright Alfrothul bears\nEre Fenrir snatches her forth;\nHer mother's paths shall the maiden tread\nWhen the gods to death have gone.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n48. \"Much have I fared, much have I found,\nMuch have I got of the gods:\nWhat maidens are they, so wise of mind.\nThat forth o'er the sea shall fare?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n49. \"O'er Mogthrasir's hill shall the maidens pass,\nAnd three are their throngs that come;\nThey all shall protect the dwellers on earth,\nThough they come of the giants' kin.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n50. \"Much have I fared, much have I found,\nMuch have I got of the gods:\nWho then shall rule the realm of the gods,\nWhen the fires of Surt have sunk?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n51. \"In the gods' home Vithar and Vali shall dwell,\nWhen the fires of Surt have sunk;\nMothi and Magni shall Mjollnir have\nWhen Vingnir falls in fight.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n52. \"Much have I fared, much have I found,\nMuch have I got of the gods:\nWhat shall bring the doom of death to Othin,\nWhen the gods to destruction go?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n53. \"The wolf shall fell the father of men,\nAnd this shall Vithar avenge;\nThe terrible jaws shall he tear apart,\nAnd so the wolf shall he slay.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n54. \"Much have I fared, much have I found,\nMuch have I got from the gods:\nWhat spake Othin himself in the ears of his son,\nEre in the bale-fire he burned?\"\n\n<i>Vafthruthnir spake:</i>\n55. \"No man can tell what in olden time\nThou spak'st in the ears of thy son;\nWith fated mouth the fall of the gods\nAnd mine olden tales have I told;\nWith Othin in knowledge now have I striven,\nAnd ever the wiser thou art.\""
