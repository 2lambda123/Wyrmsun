	text = "~<The Lay of Thrym~>\n\n1. Wild was Vingthor when he awoke,\nAnd when his mighty hammer he missed;\nHe shook his beard, his hair was bristling,\nAs the son of Jorth about him sought.\n\n2. Hear now the speech that first he spake:\n\"Harken, Loki, and heed my words,\nNowhere on earth is it known to man,\nNor in heaven above: our hammer is stolen.\"\n\n3. To the dwelling fair of Freyja went they,\nHear now the speech that first he spake:\n\"Wilt thou, Freyja, thy feather-dress lend me,\nThat so my hammer I may seek?\"\n\n<i>Freyja spake:</i>\n4. \"Thine should it be though of silver bright,\nAnd I would give it though 'twere of gold.\"\nThen Loki flew, and the feather-dress whirred,\nTill he left behind him the home of the gods,\nAnd reached at last the realm of the giants.\n\n5. Thrym sat on a mound, the giants' master,\nLeashes of gold he laid for his dogs,\nAnd stroked and smoothed the manes of his steeds.\n\n<i>Thrym spake:</i>\n6. \"How fare the gods, how fare the elves?\nWhy comst thou alone to the giants' land?\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n\"Ill fare the gods, ill fare the elves!\nHast thou hidden Hlorrithi's hammer?\"\n\n<i>Thrym spake:</i>\n7. \"I have hidden Hlorrithi's hammer,\nEight miles down deep in the earth;\nAnd back again shall no man bring it\nIf Freyja I win not to be my wife.\"\n\n8. Then Loki flew, and the feather-dress whirred,\nTill he left behind him the home of the giants,\nAnd reached at last the realm of the gods.\nThere in the courtyard Thor he met:\nHear now the speech that first he spake:\n\n9. \"Hast thou found tidings as well as trouble?\nThy news in the air shalt thou utter now;\nOft doth the sitter his story forget,\nAnd lies he speaks who lays himself down.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n10. \"Trouble I have, and tidings as well:\nThrym, king of the giants, keeps thy hammer,\nAnd back again shall no man bring it\nIf Freyja he wins not to be his wife.\"\n\n11. Freyja the fair then went they to find\nHear now the speech that first he spake:\n\"Bind on, Freyja, the bridal veil,\nFor we two must haste to the giants' home.\"\n\n12. Wrathful was Freyja, and fiercely she snorted,\nAnd the dwelling great of the gods was shaken,\nAnd burst was the mighty Brisings' necklace:\n\"Most lustful indeed should I look to all\nIf I journeyed with thee to the giants' home.\"\n\n13. Then were the gods together met,\nAnd the goddesses came and council held,\nAnd the far-famed ones a plan would find,\nHow they might Hlorrithi's hammer win.\n\n14. Then Heimdall spake, whitest of the gods,\nLike the Wanes he knew the future well:\n\"Bind we on Thor the bridal veil,\nLet him bear the mighty Brisings' necklace;\n\n15. \"Keys around him let there rattle,\nAnd down to his knees hang woman's dress;\nWith gems full broad upon his breast,\nAnd a pretty cap to crown his head.\"\n\n16. Then Thor the mighty his answer made:\n\"Me would the gods unmanly call\nIf I let bind the bridal veil.\"\n\n17. Then Loki spake, the son of Laufey:\n\"Be silent, Thor, and speak not thus;\nElse will the giants in Asgarth dwell\nIf thy hammer is brought not home to thee.\"\n\n8. Then bound they on Thor the bridal veil,\nAnd next the mighty Brisings' necklace.\n\n19. Keys around him let they rattle,\nAnd down to his knees hung woman's dress;\nWith gems full broad upon his breast,\nAnd a pretty cap to crown his head.\n\n20. Then Loki spake, the son of Laufey:\n\"As thy maid-servant thither I go with thee;\nWe two shall haste to the giants' home.\"\n\n21. Then home the goats to the hall were driven,\nThey wrenched at the halters, swift were they to run;\nThe mountains burst, earth burned with fire,\nAnd Othin's son sought Jotunheim.\n\n22. Then loud spake Thrym, the giants' leader:\n\"Bestir ye, giants, put straw on the benches;\nNow Freyja they bring to be my bride,\nThe daughter of Njorth out of Noatun.\n\n23. \"Gold-horned cattle go to my stables,\nJet-black oxen, the giant's joy;\nMany my gems, and many my jewels,\nFreyja alone did I lack, methinks.\"\n\n24. Early it was to evening come,\nAnd forth was borne the beer for the giants;\nThor alone ate an ox, and eight salmon,\nAll the dainties as well that were set for the women;\nAnd drank Sif's mate three tuns of mead.\n\n25. Then loud spake Thrym, the giants' leader:\n\"Who ever saw bride more keenly bite?\nI ne'er saw bride with a broader bite,\nNor a maiden who drank more mead than this!\"\n\n26. Hard by there sat the serving-maid wise,\nSo well she answered the giant's words:\n\"From food has Freyja eight nights fasted,\nSo hot was her longing for Jotunheim.\"\n\n27. Thrym looked 'neath the veil, for he longed to kiss,\nBut back he leaped the length of the hall:\n\"Why are so fearful the eyes of Freyja?\nFire, methinks, from her eyes burns forth.\"\n\n28. Hard by there sat the serving-maid wise,\nSo well she answered the giant's words:\n\"No sleep has Freyja for eight nights found,\nSo hot was her longing for Jotunheim.\"\n\n29. Soon came the giant's luckless sister,\nWho feared not to ask the bridal fee:\n\"From thy hands the rings of red gold take,\nIf thou wouldst win my willing love,\n(My willing love and welcome glad.)\"\n\n30: Then loud spake Thrym, the giants' leader:\n\"Bring in the hammer to hallow the bride;\nOn the maiden's knees let Mjollnir lie,\nThat us both the band of Vor may bless.\"\n\n31. The heart in the breast of Hlorrithi laughed\nWhen the hard-souled one his hammer beheld;\nFirst Thrym, the king of the giants, he killed,\nThen all the folk of the giants he felled.\n\n32. The giant's sister old he slew,\nShe who had begged the bridal fee;\nA stroke she got in the shilling's stead,\nAnd for many rings the might of the hammer.\n\n33. And so his hammer got Othin's son."
