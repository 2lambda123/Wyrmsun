		text = "[i]The Ballad of Grimnir[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe [i]Grimnismol[/i] follows the [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i] in the [i]Codex[/i] [i]Regius[/i] and is also found complete in the [i]Arnamagnæan[/i] [i]Codex[/i], where also it follows the [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i]. Snorri quotes over twenty of its stanzas.\n\nLike the preceding poem, the [i]Grimnismol[/i] is largely encyclopedic in nature, and consists chiefly of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. Othin, concealed under the name of Grimnir, is through an error tortured by King Geirröth. Bound between two blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king's little son, Agnar, who has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true name, or rather names, to the terrified Geirröth, and the latter falls on his sward and is killed.\n\nFor much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose statement of the manner of Geirröth's death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.\n\nWithout discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories"

		text = "themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story telling, and in some of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose \"links\" between dialogue stanzas.\n\nThe applications of this fact, which has been too often over looked, are almost limitless, for it suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called \"popular\" epic. It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages before such a poem as the [i]Iliad[/i]. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.\n\nInterpolations in such a poem as the [i]Grimnismol[/i] could have been made easily enough, and many stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.\n\nKing Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other Geirröth. Agnar was ten winters old, and Geirröth eight. Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for\n\n[Prose. The texts of the two manuscripts differ in many minor details. [i]Hrauthung[/i]: this mythical king is not mentioned elsewhere.

They had a fair wind, and came to their father's landing-place. Geirröth was forward in the boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, \"Go thou now where evil may have thee!\" The boat drifted out to sea. Geirröth, however, went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then Geirröth was made king, and became a renowned man.\n\nOthin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. Othin said: \"Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave? But Geirröth, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.\" Frigg said: \"He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come to him.\" Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about this matter. Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to Geirröth. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that King Geirröth was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack.

King Geirröth had a son ten winters old, and called Agnar after his father's brother. Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented with out cause. Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on Grimnir's back. He spake:\n\n1. Hot art thou, fire! | too fierce by far;\nGet ye now gone, ye flames!\nThe mantle is burnt, | though I bear it aloft,\nAnd the fire scorches the fur.\n\n2.

For line 4 both manuscripts have \"the land of the Goths\" instead of simply \"the Goths.\" The word \"Goths\" apparently was applied indiscriminately to any South-Germanic people, including the Burgundians as well as the actual Goths, and thus here has no specific application; cf.

The spelling of the names of the rivers varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions. It is needless here to point out the many attempted emendations of this list. For a passage presenting similar problems, cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 10-16. Snorri virtually quotes stanzas 27-29 in his prose, though not consecutively. The name [i]Rin[/i], in line 3, is identical with that for the River Rhine which appears frequently in the hero poems, but the similarity is doubt less purely accidental.\n\n28. [i]Slith[/i] may possibly be the same river as that mentioned in Voluspo, 36, as flowing through the giants' land.

Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun.

[i]Hild[/i]: \"Warrior.\" [i]Thruth[/i]: \"Might.\" [i]Hlok[/i]: \"Shrieking.\" [i]Herfjotur[/i]: \"Host-Fetter.\" [i]Gol[/i]: \"Screaming.\" [i]Geironul[/i]: \"Spear-Bearer.\" [i]Randgrith[/i]: \"Shield-Bearer.\" [i]Rathgrith[/i]: Gering guesses \"Plan-Destroyer.\" [i]Reginleif[/i]: \"Gods'-Kin.\" Manuscripts and editions vary greatly in the spelling of these names, and hence in their significance.\n\n37. Müllenhoff suspects stanzas 37-41 to have been interpolated, and Edzardi thinks they may have come from the [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i]. Snorri closely paraphrases stanzas 37-39, and quotes 40-41. [i]Arvak[/i] (\"Early Waker\") and [i]Alsvith[/i] (\"All Swift\"): the horses of the sun, named also in [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i], 15. According to Snorri: \"There was a man called Mundilfari, who had two children; they were so fair and lovely that he called his son Mani and his daughter Sol. The gods were angry at this presumption, and took the children and set them up in heaven; and they bade Sol drive the horses that drew the car of the sun]"

Skoll is the wolf | that to Ironwood\nFollows the glittering god,\nAnd the son of Hrothvitnir, | Hati, awaits\nThe burning bride of heaven.\n\n40. Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth,\nAnd the ocean out of his blood;\nOf his bones the hills, | of his hair the trees,\nOf his skull the heavens high.\n\n[which the gods had made to light the world from the sparks which flew out of Muspellsheim. The horses were called Alsvith and Arvak, and under their yokes the gods set two bellows to cool them, and in some songs these are called 'the cold iron.'\"\n\n38. [i]Svalin[/i] (\"The Cooling\"): the only other reference to this shield is in [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i], 15.\n\n39. [i]Skoll[/i] and [i]Hati[/i]: the wolves that devour respectively the sun and moon. The latter is the son of Hrothvitnir (\"The Mighty Wolf,\" i. e. Fenrir); cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 40, and [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i], 46-47, in which Fenrir appears as the thief. [i]Ironwood[/i]: a conjectural emendation of an obscure phrase; cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 40.\n\n40. This and the following stanza are quoted by Snorri. They seem to have come from a different source from the others of this poem; Edzardi suggests an older version of the [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i]. This stanza is closely parallel to [i]Vafthruthnismol[/i], 21, which see, as also [i]Voluspo[/i], 3. Snorri, following this account, has a few details to add. The stones were made out of Ymir's teeth and such of his bones as were broken. Mithgarth was a mountain-wall made out of Ymir's eyebrows, and set around the earth because of the enmity of the giants.]"

His the favor of Ull | and of all the gods\nWho first in the flames will reach;\nFor the house can be seen | by the sons of the gods\nIf the kettle aside were cast.\n\n43. In days of old | did Ivaldi's sons\nSkithblathnir fashion fair,\n\The best of ships | for the bright god Freyr,\nThe noble son of Njorth.\n\n[42. With this stanza Othin gets back to his immediate situation, bound as he is between two fires. He calls down a blessing on the man who will reach into the fire and pull aside the great kettle which, in Icelandic houses, hung directly under the smoke vent in the roof, and thus kept any one above from looking down into the interior. On [i]Ull[/i], the archer-god, cf. stanza 5 and note. He is specified here apparently for no better reason than that his name fits the initial-rhyme.\n\n43. This and the following stanza are certainly interpolated, for they have nothing to do with the context, and stanza 45 continues the dramatic conclusion of the poem begun in stanza 42. This stanza is quoted by Snorri. [i]Ivaldi[/i] (\"The Mighty\"): he is known only as the father of the craftsmen-dwarfs who made not only the ship Skithblathnir, but also Othin's spear Gungnir, and the golden hair for Thor's wife, Sif, after Loki had maliciously cut her own hair off. [i]Skithblathnir[/i]: this ship (\"Wooden-Bladed\") always had a fair wind, whenever the sail was set; it could be folded up at will and put in the pocket. [i]Freyr[/i]: concerning him and his father, see Voluspo, 21, note, and [i]Skirnismol[/i], introductory prose and note.]"

The best of trees | must Yggdrasil be,\nSkithblathnir best of boats;\nOf all the gods | is Othin the greatest,\nAnd Sleipnir the best of steeds;\nBifrost of bridges, | Bragi of skalds,\nHobrok of hawks, | and Garm of hounds.\n\n45. To the race of the gods | my face have I raised,\nAnd the wished-for aid have I waked;\nFor to all the gods | has the message gone\nThat sit in Ægir's seats,\nThat drink within Ægir's doors.\n\n[44. Snorri quotes this stanza. Like stanza 43 an almost certain interpolation, it was probably drawn in by the reference to Skithblathnir in the stanza interpolated earlier. It is presumably in faulty condition. One Ms. has after the fifth line half of a sixth,--\"Brimir of swords.\" [i]Yggdrasil[/i]: cf. stanzas 25-35. [i]Skithblathnir[/i]: cf. stanza 43, note. [i]Sleipnir[/i]: Othin's eight-legged horse, one of Loki's numerous progeny, borne by him to the stallion Svathilfari. This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari's aid, as to make the gods fear he would win his promised reward--Freyja and the sun and moon. To delay the work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant failed to complete his task within the stipulated time. [i]Bilrost[/i]: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza), on which cf. stanza 29. [i]Bragi[/i]: the god of poetry. He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned only three times in the poems of the [i]Edda[/i]. In Snorri's [i]Edda[/i], however, he is of great importance. His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth. Perhaps the Norwegian skald Bragi Boddason, the oldest recorded skaldic poet, had been traditionally apotheosized as early as the tenth century. [i]Hobrok[/i]: nothing further is known of him. [i]Garm[/i]: cf. Voluspo, 44.\n\n45. With this stanza the narrative current of the poem is resumed. Ægir: the sea-god; cf. [i]Lokasenna[/i], introductory prose.]"

Concerning the condition of stanzas 46-50, quoted by Snorri, nothing definite can be said. Lines and entire stanzas of this \"catalogue\" sort undoubtedly came and went with great freedom all through the period of oral transmission. Many of the names are not mentioned elsewhere, and often their significance is sheer guesswork. As in nearly every episode Othin appeared in disguise, the number of his names was necessarily almost limitless. [i]Grim[/i]: \"The Hooded.\" [i]Gangleri[/i]: \"The Wanderer.\" [i]Herjan[/i]: \"The Ruler.\" [i]Hjalmberi[/i]: \"The Helmet-Bearer.\" [i]Thekk[/i]: \"The Much-Loved.\" [i]Thrithi[/i]: \"The Third\" (in Snorri's Edda the stories are all told in the form of answers to questions, the speakers being Har, Jafnhar and Thrithi. Just what this tripartite form of Othin signifies has been the source of endless debate. Probably this line is late enough to betray the somewhat muddled influence of early Christianity.) [i]Thuth[/i] and [i]Uth[/i]: both names defy guesswork. [i]Helblindi[/i]: \"Hel-Blinder\" (two manuscripts have [i]Herblindi[/i]--\"Host-Blinder\"). [i]Hor[/i]: \"The High One.\"\n\n47. [i]Sath[/i]: \"The Truthful.\" [i]Svipal[/i]: \"The Changing.\" [i]Sanngetal[/i]: \"The Truth-Teller.\" [i]Herteit[/i]: \"Glad of the Host.\" [i]Hnikar[/i]: \"The Overthrower.\" [i]Bileyg[/i]: \"The Shifty-Eyed.\" [i]Baleyg[/i]: \"The Flaming-Eyed.\" [i]Bolverk[/i]: \"Doer of Ill\" (cf. Hovamol, 104 and note). [i]Fjolnir[/i]: \"The Many-Shaped.\" [i]Grimnir[/i]: \"The Hooded.\" [i]Glapswith[/i]: \"Swift in Deceit.\" [i]Fjolsvith[/i]: \"Wide of Wisdom.\"\n\n48.

Nothing is known of Asmund, of Othin's appearance as Jalk, or of the occasion when he \"went in a sledge\" as Kjalar (\"Ruler of Keels\"?). [i]Thror[/i] and [i]Vithur[/i] are also of uncertain meaning. [i]Oski[/i]: \"God of Wishes.\" [i]Biflindi[/i]: the manuscripts vary widely in the form of this name. [i]Jafnhor[/i]: \"Equally High\" (cf. note on stanza 46). [i]Omi[/i]: \"The Shouter.\" [i]Gondlir[/i]: \"Wand Bearer.\" [i]Harbarth[/i]: \"Graybeard\" (cf.

Again the poem returns to the direct action, Othin addressing the terrified Geirröth. The manuscripts show no lacuna.

The sword slipped from his hand, and fell with the hilt down. The king stumbled and fell forward, and the sword pierced him through, and slew him. Then Othin vanished, but Agnar long ruled there as king."
