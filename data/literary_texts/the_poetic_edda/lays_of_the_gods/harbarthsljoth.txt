Thor called out:\n\n1. \"Who is the fellow yonder, on the farther shore of the sound?\"\n\n<i>The ferryman spake:</i>\n2. \"What kind of a peasant is yon, that calls o'er the bay?\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n3. \"Ferry me over the sound; I will feed thee therefor in the morning;\nA basket I have on my back, and food therein, none better;\nAt leisure I ate, ere the house I left,\nOf herrings and porridge, so plenty I had.\"\n\n<i>The ferryman spake:</i>\n4. \"Of thy morning feats art thou proud, but the future thou knowest not wholly;\nDoleful thine home-coming is: thy mother, me thinks, is dead.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n5. \"Now hast thou said what to each must seem\nThe mightiest grief, that my mother is dead.\"\n\n<i>The ferryman spake:</i>\n6. \"Three good dwellings, methinks, thou hast not;\nBarefoot thou standest, and wearest a beggar's dress;\nNot even hose dost thou have.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n7. \"Steer thou hither the boat; the landing here shall I show thee;\nBut whose the craft that thou keepest on the shore?\"\n\n<i>The ferryman spake:</i>\n8. \"Hildolf is he who bade me have it,\nA hero wise; his home is at Rathsey's sound.\nHe bade me no robbers to steer, nor stealers of steeds,\nBut worthy men, and those whom well do I know.\nSay now thy name, if over the sound thou wilt fare.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n9. \"My name indeed shall I tell, though in danger I am,\nAnd all my race; I am Othin's son,\nMeili's brother, and Magni's father,\nThe strong one of the gods; with Thor now speech canst thou get.\nAnd now would I know what name thou hast.\"\n\n<i>The ferryman spake:</i>\n10. \"Harbarth am I, and seldom I hide my name.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n11. \"Why shouldst thou hide thy name, if quarrel thou hast not?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n12. \"And though I had a quarrel, from such as thou art\nYet none the less my life would I guard,\nUnless I be doomed to die.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n13. \"Great trouble, methinks, would it be to come to thee,\nTo wade the waters across, and wet my middle;\nWeakling, well shall I pay thy mocking words,\nif across the sound I come.\"\n\nHarbarth spake:\n14. \"Here shall I stand and await thee here;\nThou hast found since Hrungnir died no fiercer man.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n15. \"Fain art thou to tell how with Hrungnir I fought,\nThe haughty giant, whose head of stone was made;\nAnd yet I felled him, and stretched him before me.\nWhat, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n16. \"Five full winters with Fjolvar was I,\nAnd dwelt in the isle that is Algr√∂n called;\nThere could we fight, and fell the slain,\nMuch could we seek, and maids could master.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n17. \"How won ye success with your women?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n18. \"Lively women we had, if they wise for us were;\nWise were the women we had, if they kind for us were;\nFor ropes of sand they would seek to wind,\nAnd the bottom to dig from the deepest dale.\nWiser than all in counsel I was,\nAnd there I slept by the sisters seven,\nAnd joy full great did I get from each.\nWhat, Thor, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n19. \"Thjazi I felled, the giant fierce,\nAnd I hurled the eyes of Alvaldi's son\nTo the heavens hot above;\nOf my deeds the mightiest marks are these,\nThat all men since can see.\nWhat, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spoke:</i>\n20. \"Much love-craft I wrought with them who ride by night,\nWhen I stole them by stealth from their husbands;\nA giant hard was Hlebarth, methinks:\nHis wand he gave me as gift,\nAnd I stole his wits away.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n21. \"Thou didst repay good gifts with evil mind.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n22. \"The oak must have what it shaves from another;\nIn such things each for himself.\nWhat, Thor, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n23. \"Eastward I fared, of the giants I felled\nTheir ill-working women who went to the mountain;\nAnd large were the giants' throng if all were alive;\nNo men would there be in Mithgarth more.\nWhat, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n24. \"In Valland I was, and wars I raised,\nPrinces I angered, and peace brought never;\nThe noble who fall in the fight hath Othin,\nAnd Thor hath the race of the thralls.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n25. \"Unequal gifts of men wouldst thou give to the gods,\nIf might too much thou shouldst have.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n26. \"Thor has might enough, but never a heart;\nFor cowardly fear in a glove wast thou fain to crawl,\nAnd there forgot thou wast Thor;\nAfraid there thou wast, thy fear was such,\nTo fart or sneeze lest Fjalar should hear.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n27. \"Thou womanish Harbarth, to hell would I smite thee straight,\nCould mine arm reach over the sound.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n28. \"Wherefore reach over the sound, since strife we have none?\nWhat, Thor, didst thou do then?\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n29. \"Eastward I was, and the river I guarded well,\nWhere the sons of Svarang sought me there;\nStones did they hurl; small joy did they have of winning;\nBefore me there to ask for peace did they fare.\nWhat, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n30. \"Eastward I was, and spake with a certain one,\nI played with the linen-white maid, and met her by stealth;\nI gladdened the gold-decked one, and she granted me joy.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n31. \"Full fair was thy woman-finding.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n32. \"Thy help did I need then, Thor, to hold the white maid fast.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n33. \"Gladly, had I been there, my help to thee had been given.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n34. \"I might have trusted thee then, didst thou not betray thy troth.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n35. \"No heel-biter am I, in truth, like an old leather shoe in spring.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spoke:</i>\n36. \"What, Thor, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n37. \"In Hlesey the brides of the Berserkers slew I;\nMost evil they were, and all they betrayed.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n38. \"Shame didst thou win, that women thou slewest, Thor.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n39. \"She-wolves they were like, and women but little;\nMy ship, which well I had trimmed, did they shake;\nWith clubs of iron they threatened, and Thjalfi they drove off.\nWhat, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n40. \"In the host I was that hither fared,\nThe banners to raise, and the spear to redden.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n41. \"Wilt thou now say that hatred thou soughtest to bring us?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n42. \"A ring for thy hand shall make all right for thee,\nAs the judge decides who sets us two at peace.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n43. \"Where foundest thou so foul and scornful a speech?\nMore foul a speech I never before have heard.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n44. \"I learned it from men, the men so old,\nWho dwell in the hills of home.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n45. \"A name full good to heaps of stones thou givest\nWhen thou callest them hills of home.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n46. \"Of such things speak I so.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n47. \"Ill for thee comes thy keenness of tongue,\nIf the water I choose to wade;\nLouder, I ween, than a wolf thou cryest,\nIf a blow of my hammer thou hast.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n48. \"Sif has a lover at home, and him shouldst thou meet;\nMore fitting it were on him to put forth thy strength.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n49. \"Thy tongue still makes thee say what seems most ill to me,\nThou witless man! Thou liest, I ween.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n50. \"Truth do I speak, but slow on thy way thou art;\nFar hadst thou gone if now in the boat thou hadst fared.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n51. \"Thou womanish Harbarth! here hast thou held me too long.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n52. \"I thought not ever that Asathor would be hindered\nBy a ferryman thus from faring.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n53. \"One counsel I bring thee now: row hither thy boat;\nNo more of scoffing; set Magni's father across.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n54. \"From the sound go hence; the passage thou hast not.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n55. \"The way now show me, since thou takest me not o'er the water.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n56. \"To refuse it is little, to fare it is long;\nA while to the stock, and a while to the stone;\nThen the road to thy left, till Verland thou reachest;\nAnd there shall Fjorgyn her son Thor find,\nAnd the road of her children she shows him to Othin's realm.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n57. \"May I come so far in a day?\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n58. \"With toil and trouble perchance,\nWhile the sun still shines, or so I think.\"\n\n<i>Thor spake:</i>\n59. \"Short now shall be our speech, for thou speakest in mockery only;\nThe passage thou gavest me not I shall pay thee if ever we meet.\"\n\n<i>Harbarth spake:</i>\n60. \"Get hence where every evil thing shall have thee!\""
