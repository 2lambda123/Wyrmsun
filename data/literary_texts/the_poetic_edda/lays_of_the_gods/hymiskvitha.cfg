		text = "[i]The Lay of Hymir[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe [i]Hymiskvitha[/i] is found complete in both manuscripts; in [i]Regius[/i] it follows the [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], while in the [i]Arnamagnæan[/i] [i]Codex[/i] it comes after the [i]Grimnismol[/i]. Snorri does not quote it, although he tells the main story involved.\n\nThe poem is a distinctly inferior piece of work, obviously based on various narrative fragments, awkwardly pieced together. Some critics, Jessen and Edzardi for instance, have maintained that the compiler had before him three distinct poems, which he simply put together; others, like Finnur Jonsson and Mogk, think that the author made a new poem of his own on the basis of earlier poems, now lost. It seems probable that he took a lot of odds and ends of material concerning Thor, whether in prose or in verse, and worked them together in a perfunctory way, without much caring how well they fitted. His chief aim was probably to impress the credulous imaginations of hearers greedy for wonders.\n\nThe poem is almost certainly one of the latest of those dealing with the gods, though Finnur Jonsson, in order to support his theory of a Norwegian origin, has to date it relatively early. If, as seems probable, it was produced in Iceland, the chances are that it was composed in the first half of the eleventh century. Jessen, rather recklessly, goes so far as to put it two hundred years later. In any case, it belongs to a period of literary decadence,--the great days of Eddic poetry would never have permitted the nine hundred headed person found in Hymir's home-- and to one in which the usual forms of diction in mythological poetry had yielded somewhat to the verbal subtleties of skaldic verse.\n\nWhile the skaldic poetry properly falls outside the limits of this book, it is necessary here to say a word about it. There is preserved, in the sagas and elsewhere, a very considerable body of lyric poetry, the authorship of each poem being nearly always definitely stated, whether correctly or otherwise. This type of poetry is marked by an extraordinary complexity of diction, with a peculiarly difficult vocabulary of its own. It was to explain some of the \"kennings\" which composed this special"

		text = "vocabulary that Snorri wrote one of the sections of the [i]Prose[/i] [i]Edda[/i]. As an illustration, in a single stanza of one poem in the [i]Egilssaga[/i], a sword is called \"the halo of the helm,\" \"the wound-hoe,\" \"the blood-snake\" (possibly; no one is sure what the compound word means) and \"the ice of the girdle,\" while men appear in the same stanza as \"Othin's ash-trees,\" and battle is spoken of as \"the iron game.\" One of the eight lines has defied translation completely.\n\nSkaldic diction made relatively few inroads into the earlier Eddic poems, but in the [i]Hymiskvitha[/i] these circumlocutions are fairly numerous. This sets the poem somewhat apart from the rest of the mythological collection. Only the vigor of the two main stories--Thor's expedition after Hymir's kettle and the fishing trip in which he caught Mithgarthsorm--saves it from complete mediocrity.\n\n1. Of old the gods | made feast together,\nAnd drink they sought | ere sated they were;\nTwigs they shook, | and blood they tried:\nRich fare in Ægir's | hall they found.\n\n[1. [i]Twigs[/i]: Vigfusson comments at some length on \"the rite practised in the heathen age of inquiring into the future by dipping bunches of chips or twigs into the blood (of sacrifices) and shaking them.\" But the two operations may have been separate, the twigs being simply \"divining-rods\" marked with runes. In either case, the gods were seeking information by magic as to where they could find plenty to drink. [i]Ægir[/i]: a giant who is also the god of the sea; little is known of him outside of what is told here and in the introductory prose to the [i]Lokasenna[/i], though Snorri has a brief account of him, giving his home as Hlesey (Läsö, cf. [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 37). [i]Grimnismol[/i], 45, has a reference to this same feast.]"

It is not clear why Tyr, who is elsewhere spoken of as a son of Othin, should here call Hymir his father. Finnur Jonsson, in an attempt to get round this difficulty, deliberately changed the word \"father\" to \"grandfather,\" but this does not help greatly.\n\n6. Neither manuscript has any superscriptions, but most editors have supplied them as above. From this point through stanza it the editors have varied considerably in grouping the lines into stanzas. The manuscripts indicate the third lines of stanzas 7, 8, 9, and to as beginning stanzas, but this makes more complications than the present arrangement. It is possible that, as Sijmons suggests, two lines have been lost after stanza 6.\n\n7. [i]Egil[/i]: possibly, though by no means certainly, the father of Thor's servant, Thjalfi, for, according to Snorri, Thor's first stop on this journey was at the house of a peasant whose children, Thjalfi and Roskva, he took into his service; cf. stanza 38, note. The [i]Arnamagnæan[/i] [i]Codex[/i] has \"Ægir\" instead of \"Egil,\" but, aside from the fact that Thor had just left Ægir's house, the sea-god can hardly have been spoken of as a goat-herd.\n\n8.

Two or three editors give this stanza a superscription (\"The concubine spake\", \"The daughter spake\"). Line 3 is commonly regarded as spurious. [i]The[/i] [i]foeman[/i] [i]of[/i] [i]Hroth[/i]: of course this means Thor, but nothing is known of any enemy of his by this name. Several editors have sought to make a single word meaning \"the famous enemy\" out of the phrase.

In Snorri's version, Thor pulls so hard on the line that he drives both his feet through the flooring of the boat, and stands on bottom. When he pulls the serpent up, Hymir cuts the line with his bait-knife, which explains the serpent's escape. Thor, in a rage, knocks Hymir overboard with his hammer, and then wades ashore.
