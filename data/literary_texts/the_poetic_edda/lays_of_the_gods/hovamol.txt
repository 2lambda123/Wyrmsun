	text = "~<The Ballad of the High One~>\n\n1. Within the gates | ere a man shall go,\n(Full warily let him watch,)\nFull long let him look about him;\nFor little he knows | where a foe may lurk,\nAnd sit in the seats within.\n\n2. Hail to the giver! | a guest has come;\nWhere shall the stranger sit?\nSwift shall he be who, | with swords shall try\nThe proof of his might to make.\n\n3. Fire he needs | who with frozen knees\nHas come from the cold without;\nFood and clothes | must the farer have,\nThe man from the mountains come.\n\n4. Water and towels | and welcoming speech\nShould he find who comes, to the feast;\nIf renown he would get, | and again be greeted,\nWisely and well must he act.\n\n5. Wits must he have | who wanders wide,\nBut all is easy at home;\nAt the witless man | the wise shall wink\nWhen among such men he sits.\n\n6. A man shall not boast | of his keenness of mind,\nBut keep it close in his breast;\nTo the silent and wise | does ill come seldom\nWhen he goes as guest to a house;\n(For a faster friend | one never finds\nThan wisdom tried and true.)\n\n7. The knowing guest | who goes to the feast,\nIn silent attention sits;\nWith his ears he hears, | with his eyes he watches,\nThus wary are wise men all.\n\n8. Happy the one | who wins for himself\nFavor and praises fair;\nLess safe by far | is the wisdom found\nThat is hid in another's heart.\n\n9. Happy the man | who has while he lives\nWisdom and praise as well,\nFor evil counsel | a man full oft\nHas from another's heart.\n\n10. A better burden | may no man bear\nFor wanderings wide than wisdom;\nIt is better than wealth | on unknown ways,\nAnd in grief a refuge it gives.\n\n11. A better burden | may no man bear\nFor wanderings wide than wisdom;\nWorse food for the journey | he brings not afield\nThan an over-drinking of ale.\n\n12. Less good there lies | than most believe\nIn ale for mortal men;\nFor the more he drinks | the less does man\nOf his mind the mastery hold.\n\n13. Over beer the bird | of forgetfulness broods,\nAnd steals the minds of men;\nWith the heron's feathers | fettered I lay\nAnd in Gunnloth's house was held.\n\n14. Drunk I was, | I was dead-drunk,\nWhen with Fjalar wise I was;\n'Tis the best of drinking | if back one brings\nHis wisdom with him home.\n\n15. The son of a king | shall be silent and wise,\nAnd bold in battle as well;\nBravely and gladly | a man shall go,\nTill the day of his death is come.\n\n16. The sluggard believes | he shall live forever,\nIf the fight he faces not;\nBut age shall not grant him | the gift of peace,\nThough spears may spare his life.\n\n17. The fool is agape | when he comes to the feast,\nHe stammers or else is still;\nBut soon if he gets | a drink is it seen\nWhat the mind of the man is like.\n\n18. He alone is aware | who has wandered wide,\nAnd far abroad has fared,\nHow great a mind | is guided by him\nThat wealth of wisdom has.\n\n19. Shun not the mead, | but drink in measure;\nSpeak to the point or be still;\nFor rudeness none | shall rightly blame thee\nIf soon thy bed thou seekest.\n\n20. The greedy man, | if his mind be vague,\nWill eat till sick he is;\nThe vulgar man, | when among the wise,\nTo scorn by his belly is brought.\n\n21. The herds know well | when home they shall fare,\nAnd then from the grass they go;\nBut the foolish man | his belly's measure\nShall never know aright.\n\n22. A paltry man | and poor of mind\nAt all things ever mocks;\nFor never he knows, | what he ought to know,\nThat he is not free from faults.\n\n23. The witless man | is awake all night,\nThinking of many things;\nCare-worn he is | when the morning comes,\nAnd his woe is just as it was.\n\n24. The foolish man | for friends all those\nWho laugh at him will hold;\nWhen among the wise | he marks it not\nThough hatred of him they speak.\n\n25. The foolish man | for friends all those\nWho laugh at him will hold;\nBut the truth when he comes | to the council he learns,\nThat few in his favor will speak.\n\n26. An ignorant man | thinks that all he knows,\nWhen he sits by himself in a corner;\nBut never what answer | to make he knows,\nWhen others with questions come.\n\n27. A witless man, | when he meets with men,\nHad best in silence abide;\nFor no one shall find | that nothing he knows,\nIf his mouth is not open too much.\n(But a man knows not, | if nothing he knows,\nWhen his mouth has been open too much.)\n\n28. Wise shall he seem | who well can question,\nAnd also answer well;\nNought is concealed | that men may say\nAmong the sons of men.\n\n29. Often he speaks | who never is still\nWith words that win no faith;\nThe babbling tongue, | if a bridle it find not,\nOft for itself sings ill.\n\n30. In mockery no one | a man shall hold,\nAlthough he fare to the feast;\nWise seems one oft, | if nought he is asked,\nAnd safely he sits dry-skinned.\n\n31. Wise a guest holds it | to take to his heels,\nWhen mock of another he makes;\nBut little he knows | who laughs at the feast,\nThough he mocks in the midst of his foes.\n\n32. Friendly of mind | are many men,\nTill feasting they mock at their friends;\nTo mankind a bane | must it ever be\nWhen guests together strive.\n\n33. Oft should one make | an early meal,\nNor fasting come to the feast;\nElse he sits and chews | as if he would choke,\nAnd little is able to ask.\n\n34. Crooked and far | is the road to a foe,\nThough his house on the highway be;\nBut wide and straight | is the way to a friend,\nThough far away he fare.\n\n35. Forth shall one go, | nor stay as a guest\nIn a single spot forever;\nLove becomes loathing | if long one sits\nBy the hearth in another's home.\n\n36. Better a house, | though a hut it be,\nA man is master at home;\nA pair of goats | and a patched-up roof\nAre better far than begging.\n\n37. Better a house, | though a hut it be,\nA man is master at home;\nHis heart is bleeding | who needs must beg\nWhen food he fain would have.\n\n38. Away from his arms | in the open field\nA man should fare not a foot;\nFor never he knows | when the need for a spear\nShall arise on the distant road.\n\n39. If wealth a man | has won for himself,\nLet him never suffer in need;\nOft he saves for a foe | what he plans for a friend,\nFor much goes worse than we wish.\n\n40. None so free with gifts | or food have I found\nThat gladly he took not a gift,\nNor one who so widely | scattered his wealth\nThat of recompense hatred he had.\n\n41. Friends shall gladden each other | with arms and garments,\nAs each for himself can see;\nGift-givers' friendships | are longest found,\nIf fair their fates may be.\n\n42. To his friend a man | a friend shall prove,\nAnd gifts with gifts requite;\nBut men shall mocking | with mockery answer,\nAnd fraud with falsehood meet.\n\n43. To his friend a man | a friend shall prove,\nTo him and the friend of his friend;\nBut never a man | shall friendship make\nWith one of his foeman's friends.\n\n44. If a friend thou hast | whom thou fully wilt trust,\nAnd good from him wouldst get,\nThy thoughts with his mingle, | and gifts shalt thou make,\nAnd fare to find him oft.\n\n45. If another thou hast | whom thou hardly wilt trust,\nYet good from him wouldst get,\nThou shalt speak him fair, | but falsely think,\nAnd fraud with falsehood requite.\n\n46. So is it with him | whom thou hardly wilt trust,\nAnd whose mind thou mayst not know;\nLaugh with him mayst thou, | but speak not thy mind,\nLike gifts to his shalt thou give.\n\n47. Young was I once, | and wandered alone,\nAnd nought of the road I knew;\nRich did I feel | when a comrade I found,\nFor man is man's delight.\n\n48. The lives of the brave | and noble are best,\nSorrows they seldom feed;\nBut the coward fear | of all things feels,\nAnd not gladly the niggard gives.\n\n49. My garments once | in a field I gave\nTo a pair of carven poles;\nHeroes they seemed | when clothes they had,\nBut the naked man is nought.\n\n50. On the hillside drear | the fir-tree dies,\nAll bootless its needles and bark;\nIt is like a man | whom no one loves,--\nWhy should his life be long?\n\n51. Hotter than fire | between false friends\nDoes friendship five days burn;\nWhen the sixth day comes | the fire cools,\nAnd ended is all the love.\n\n52. No great thing needs | a man to give,\nOft little will purchase praise;\nWith half a loaf | and a half-filled cup\nA friend full fast I made.\n\n53. A little sand | has a little sea,\nAnd small are the minds of men;\nThough all men are not | equal in wisdom,\nYet half-wise only are all.\n\n54. A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,\nBut never too much let him know;\nThe fairest lives | do those men live\nWhose wisdom wide has grown.\n\n55. A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,\nBut never too much let him know;\nFor the wise man's heart | is seldom happy,\nIf wisdom too great he has won.\n\n56. A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,\nBut never too much let him know;\nLet no man the fate | before him see,\nFor so is he freest from sorrow.\n\n57. A brand from a brand | is kindled and burned,\nAnd fire from fire begotten;\nAnd man by his speech | is known to men,\nAnd the stupid by their stillness.\n\n58. He must early go forth | who fain the blood\nOr the goods of another would get;\nThe wolf that lies idle | shall win little meat,\nOr the sleeping man success.\n\n59. He must early go forth | whose workers are few,\nHimself his work to seek;\nMuch remains undone | for the morning-sleeper,\nFor the swift is wealth half won.\n\n60. Of seasoned shingles | and strips of bark\nFor the thatch let one know his need,\nAnd how much of wood | he must have for a month,\nOr in half a year he will use.\n\n61. Washed and fed | to the council fare,\nBut care not too much for thy clothes;\nLet none be ashamed | of his shoes and hose,\nLess still of the steed he rides,\n(Though poor be the horse he has.)\n\n62. When the eagle comes | to the ancient sea,\nHe snaps and hangs his head;\nSo is a man | in the midst of a throng,\nWho few to speak for him finds.\n\n63. To question and answer | must all be ready\nWho wish to be known as wise;\nTell one thy thoughts, | but beware of two,--\nAll know what is known to three.\n\n64. The man who is prudent | a measured use\nOf the might he has will make;\nHe finds when among | the brave he fares\nThat the boldest he may not be.\n\n65. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\nOft for the words | that to others one speaks\nHe will get but an evil gift.\n\n66. Too early to many | a meeting I came,\nAnd some too late have I sought;\nThe beer was all drunk, | or not yet brewed;\nLittle the loathed man finds.\n\n67. To their homes men would bid | me hither and yon,\nIf at meal-time I needed no meat,\nOr would hang two hams | in my true friend's house,\nWhere only one I had eaten.\n\n68. Fire for men | is the fairest gift,\nAnd power to see the sun;\nHealth as well, | if a man may have it,\nAnd a life not stained with sin.\n\n69. All wretched is no man, | though never so sick;\nSome from their sons have joy,\nSome win it from kinsmen, | and some from their wealth,\nAnd some from worthy works.\n\n70. It is better to live | than to lie a corpse,\nThe live man catches the cow;\nI saw flames rise | for the rich man's pyre,\nAnd before his door he lay dead.\n\n71. The lame rides a horse, | the handless is herdsman,\nThe deaf in battle is bold;\nThe blind man is better | than one that is burned,\nNo good can come of a corpse.\n\n72. A son is better, | though late he be born,\nAnd his father to death have fared;\nMemory-stones | seldom stand by the road\nSave when kinsman honors his kin.\n\n73. Two make a battle, | the tongue slays the head;\nIn each furry coat | a fist I look for.\n\n74. He welcomes the night | whose fare is enough,\n(Short are the yards of a ship,)\nUneasy are autumn nights;\nFull oft does the weather | change in a week,\nAnd more in a month's time.\n\n75. A man knows not, | if nothing he knows,\nThat gold oft apes begets;\nOne man is wealthy | and one is poor,\nYet scorn for him none should know.\n\n76. Among Fitjung's sons | saw I well-stocked folds,--\nNow bear they the beggar's staff;\nWealth is as swift | as a winking eye,\nOf friends the falsest it is.\n\n77. Cattle die, | and kinsmen die,\nAnd so one dies one's self;\nBut a noble name | will never die,\nIf good renown one gets.\n\n78. Cattle die, | and kinsmen die,\nAnd so one dies one's self;\nOne thing now | that never dies,\nThe fame of a dead man's deeds.\n\n79. Certain is that | which is sought from runes,\nThat the gods so great have made,\nAnd the Master-Poet painted;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . of the race of gods:\nSilence is safest and best.\n\n80. An unwise man, | if a maiden's love\nOr wealth he chances to win,\nHis pride will wax, but his wisdom never,\nStraight forward he fares in conceit.\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n81. Give praise to the day at evening, | to a woman on her pyre,\nTo a weapon which is tried, | to a maid at wed lock,\nTo ice when it is crossed, | to ale that is drunk.\n\n82. When the gale blows hew wood, | in fair winds seek the water;\nSport with maidens at dusk, | for day's eyes are many;\nFrom the ship seek swiftness, | from the shield protection,\nCuts from the sword, | from the maiden kisses.\n\n83. By the fire drink ale, | over ice go on skates;\nBuy a steed that is lean, | and a sword when tarnished,\nThe horse at home fatten, | the hound in thy dwelling.\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n84. A man shall trust not | the oath of a maid,\nNor the word a woman speaks;\nFor their hearts on a whirling | wheel were fashioned,\nAnd fickle their breasts were formed.\n\n85. In a breaking bow | or a burning flame,\nA ravening wolf | or a croaking raven,\nIn a grunting boar, | a tree with roots broken,\nIn billowy seas | or a bubbling kettle,\n\n86. In a flying arrow | or falling waters,\nIn ice new formed | or the serpent's folds,\nIn a bride's bed-speech | or a broken sword,\nIn the sport of bears | or in sons of kings,\n\n87. In a calf that is sick | or a stubborn thrall,\nA flattering witch | or a foe new slain.\n\n88. In a brother's slayer, | if thou meet him abroad,\nIn a half-burned house, | in a horse full swift--\nOne leg is hurt | and the horse is useless--\nNone had ever such faith | as to trust in them all.\n\n89. Hope not too surely | for early harvest,\nNor trust too soon in thy son;\nThe field needs good weather, | the son needs wisdom,\nAnd oft is either denied.\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n90. The love of women | fickle of will\nIs like starting o'er ice | with a steed unshod,\nA two-year-old restive | and little tamed,\nOr steering a rudderless | ship in a storm,\nOr, lame, hunting reindeer | on slippery rocks.\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n91. Clear now will I speak, | for I know them both,\nMen false to women are found;\nWhen fairest we speak, | then falsest we think,\nAgainst wisdom we work with deceit.\n\n92. Soft words shall he speak | and wealth shall he offer\nWho longs for a maiden's love,\nAnd the beauty praise | of the maiden bright;\nHe wins whose wooing is best.\n\n93. Fault for loving | let no man find\nEver with any other;\nOft the wise are fettered, | where fools go free,\nBy beauty that breeds desire.\n\n94. Fault with another | let no man find\nFor what touches many a man;\nWise men oft | into witless fools\nAre made by mighty love.\n\n95. The head alone knows | what dwells near the heart,\nA man knows his mind alone;\nNo sickness is worse | to one who is wise\nThan to lack the longed-for joy.\n\n96. This found I myself, | when I sat in the reeds,\nAnd long my love awaited;\nAs my life the maiden | wise I loved,\nYet her I never had.\n\n97. Billing's daughter | I found on her bed,\nIn slumber bright as the sun;\nEmpty appeared | an earl's estate\nWithout that form so fair.\n\n98. \"Othin, again | at evening come,\nIf a woman thou wouldst win;\nEvil it were | if others than we\nShould know of such a sin.\"\n\n99. Away I hastened, | hoping for joy,\nAnd careless of counsel wise;\nWell I believed | that soon I should win\nMeasureless joy with the maid.\n\n100. So came I next | when night it was,\nThe warriors all were awake;\nWith burning lights | and waving brands\nI learned my luckess way.\n\n101. At morning then, | when once more I came,\nAnd all were sleeping still,\nA dog found | in the fair one's place,\nBound there upon her bed.\n\n102. Many fair maids, | if a man but tries them,\nFalse to a lover are found;\nThat did I learn | when I longed to gain\nWith wiles the maiden wise;\nFoul scorn was my meed | from the crafty maid,\nAnd nought from the woman I won.\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n103. Though glad at home, | and merry with guests,\nA man shall be wary and wise;\nThe sage and shrewd, | wide wisdom seeking,\nMust see that his speech be fair;\nA fool is he named | who nought can say,\nFor such is the way of the witless.\n\n104. I found the old giant, | now back have I fared,\nSmall gain from silence I got;\nFull many a word, | my will to get,\nI spoke in Suttung's hall.\n\n105. The mouth of Rati | made room for my passage,\nAnd space in the stone he gnawed;\nAbove and below | the giants' paths lay,\nSo rashly I risked my head.\n\n106. Gunnloth gave | on a golden stool\nA drink of the marvelous mead;\nA harsh reward | did I let her have\nFor her heroic heart,\nAnd her spirit troubled sore.\n\n107. The well-earned beauty | well I enjoyed,\nLittle the wise man lacks;\nSo Othrörir now | has up been brought\nTo the midst of the men of earth.\n\n108. Hardly, methinks, | would I home have come,\nAnd left the giants' land,\nHad not Gunnloth helped me, | the maiden good,\nWhose arms about me had been.\n\n109. The day that followed, | the frost-giants came,\nSome word of Hor to win,\n(And into the hall of Hor;)\nOf Bolverk they asked, | were he back midst the gods,\nOr had Suttung slain him there?\n\n110. On his ring swore Othin | the oath, methinks;\nWho now his troth shall trust?\nSuttung's betrayal | he sought with drink,\nAnd Gunnloth to grief he left.\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n111. It is time to chant | from the chanter's stool;\nBy the wells of Urth I was,\nI saw and was silent, | I saw and thought,\nAnd heard the speech of Hor.\n(Of runes heard I words, | nor were counsels wanting,\nAt the hall of Hor,\nIn the hall of Hor;\nSuch was the speech I heard.)\n\n112. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,---\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nRise not at night, | save if news thou seekest,\nOr fain to the outhouse wouldst fare.\n\n113. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nBeware of sleep | on a witch's bosom,\nNor let her limbs ensnare thee.\n\n114. Such is her might | that thou hast no mind\nFor the council or meeting of men;\nMeat thou hatest, | joy thou hast not,\nAnd sadly to slumber thou farest.\n\n115. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nSeek never to win | the wife of another,\nOr long for her secret love.\n\n116. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nIf o'er mountains or gulfs | thou fain wouldst go,\nLook well to thy food for the way.\n\n117. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nAn evil man | thou must not let\nBring aught of ill to thee;\nFor an evil man | will never make\nReward for a worthy thought.\n\n118. I saw a man | who was wounded sore\nBy an evil woman's word;\nA lying tongue | his death-blow launched,\nAnd no word of truth there was.\n\n119. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nIf a friend thou hast | whom thou fully wilt trust,\nThen fare to find him oft;\nFor brambles grow | and waving grass\nOn the rarely trodden road.\n\n120. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nA good man find | to hold in friendship,\nAnd give heed to his healing charms.\n\n121. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nBe never the first | to break with thy friend\nThe bond that holds you both;\nCare eats the heart | if thou canst not speak\nTo another all thy thought.\n\n122. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nExchange of words | with a witless ape\nThou must not ever make.\n\n123. For never thou mayst | from an evil man\nA good requital get;\nBut a good man oft | the greatest love\nThrough words of praise will win thee.\n\n124. Mingled is love | when a man can speak\nTo another all his thought;\nNought is so bad | as false to be,\nNo friend speaks only fair.\n\n125. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nWith a worse man speak not | three words in dispute,\nIll fares the better oft\nWhen the worse man wields a sword.\n\n126. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nA shoemaker be, | or a maker of shafts,\nFor only thy single self;\nIf the shoe is ill made, | or the shaft prove false,\nThen evil of thee men think.\n\n127. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nIf evil thou knowest, | as evil proclaim it,\nAnd make no friendship with foes.\n\n128. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nIn evil never | joy shalt thou know,\nBut glad the good shall make thee.\n\n129. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nLook not up | when the battle is on,--\n(Like madmen the sons | of men become,--)\nLest men bewitch thy wits.\n\n130. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nIf thou fain wouldst win | a woman's love,\nAnd gladness get from her,\nFair be thy promise | and well fulfilled;\nNone loathes what good he gets.\n\n131. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nI bid thee be wary, | but be not fearful;\n(Beware most with ale or another's wife,\nAnd third beware | lest a thief outwit thee.)\n\n132. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nScorn or mocking | ne'er shalt thou make\nOf a guest or a journey-goer.\n\n133. Oft scarcely he knows | who sits in the house\nWhat kind is the man who comes;\nNone so good is found | that faults he has not,\nNor so wicked that nought he is worth.\n\n134. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nScorn not ever | the gray-haired singer,\nOft do the old speak good;\n(Oft from shrivelled skin | come skillful counsels,\nThough it hang with the hides,\nAnd flap with the pelts,\nAnd is blown with the bellies.)\n\n135. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nCurse not thy guest, | nor show him thy gate,\nDeal well with a man in want.\n\n136. Strong is the beam | that raised must be\nTo give an entrance to all;\nGive it a ring, | or grim will be\nThe wish it would work on thee.\n\n137. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--\nProfit thou hast if thou hearest,\nGreat thy gain if thou learnest:\nWhen ale thou drinkest) | seek might of earth,\n(For earth cures drink, | and fire cures ills,\nThe oak cures tightness, | the ear cures magic,\nRye cures rupture, | the moon cures rage,\nGrass cures the scab, | and runes the sword-cut;)\nThe field absorbs the flood.\n\n138. Now are Hor's words | spoken in the hall,\nKind for the kindred of men,\nCursed for the kindred of giants:\nHail to the speaker, | and to him who learns!\nProfit be his who has them!\nHail to them who hearken!\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n139. I ween that I hung | on the windy tree,\nHung there for nights full nine;\nWith the spear I was wounded, | and offered I was\nTo Othin, myself to myself,\nOn the tree that none | may ever know\nWhat root beneath it runs.\n\n140. None made me happy | with loaf or horn,\nAnd there below I looked;\nI took up the runes, | shrieking I took them,\nAnd forthwith back I fell.\n\n141. Nine mighty songs | I got from the son\nOf Bolthorn, Bestla's father;\nAnd a drink I got | of the goodly mead\nPoured out from Othrörir.\n\n142. Then began I to thrive, | and wisdom to get,\nI grew and well I was;\nEach word led me on | to another word,\nEach deed to another deed.\n\n143. Runes shalt thou find, | and fateful signs,\nThat the king of singers colored,\nAnd the mighty gods have made;\nFull strong the signs, | full mighty the signs\nThat the ruler of gods doth write.\n\n144. Othin for the gods, | Dain for the elves,\nAnd Dvalin for the dwarfs,\nAlsvith for giants | and all mankind,\nAnd some myself I wrote.\n\n145. Knowest how one shall write, | knowest how one shall rede?\nKnowest how one shall tint, | knowest how one makes trial?\nKnowest how one shall ask, | knowest how one shall offer?\nKnowest how one shall send, | knowest how one shall sacrifice?\n\n146. Better no prayer | than too big an offering,\nBy thy getting measure thy gift;\nBetter is none | than too big a sacrifice,\n. . . . . . . . . .\nSo Thund of old wrote | ere man's race began,\nWhere he rose on high | when home he came.\n\n<i>* * *</i>\n\n147. The songs I know | that king's wives know not,\nNor men that are sons of men;\nThe first is called help, | and help it can bring thee\nIn sorrow and pain and sickness.\n\n148. A second I know, | that men shall need\nWho leechcraft long to use;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n149. A third I know, | if great is my need\nOf fetters to hold my foe;\nBlunt do I make | mine enemy's blade,\nNor bites his sword or staff.\n\n150. A fourth I know, | if men shall fasten\nBonds on my bended legs;\nSo great is the charm | that forth I may go,\nThe fetters spring from my feet,\nBroken the bonds from my hands.\n\n151. A fifth I know, | if I see from afar\nAn arrow fly 'gainst the folk;\nIt flies not so swift | that I stop it not,\nIf ever my eyes behold it.\n\n152. A sixth I know, | if harm one seeks\nWith a sapling's roots to send me;\nThe hero himself | who wreaks his hate\nShall taste the ill ere I.\n\n153. A seventh I know, | if I see in flames\nThe hall o'er my comrades' heads;\nIt burns not so wide | that I will not quench it,\nI know that song to sing.\n\n154. An eighth I know, | that is to all\nOf greatest good to learn;\nWhen hatred grows | among heroes' sons,\nI soon can set it right.\n\n155. A ninth I know, | if need there comes\nTo shelter my ship on the flood;\nThe wind I calm | upon the waves,\nAnd the sea I put to sleep.\n\n156. A tenth I know, | what time I see\nHouse-riders flying on high;\nSo can I work | that wildly they go,\nShowing their true shapes,\nHence to their own homes.\n\n157. An eleventh I know, | if needs I must lead\nTo the fight my long-loved friends;\nI sing in the shields, | and in strength they go\nWhole to the field of fight,\nWhole from the field of fight,\nAnd whole they come thence home.\n\n158. A twelfth I know, | if high on a tree\nI see a hanged man swing;\nSo do I write | and color the runes\nThat forth he fares,\nAnd to me talks.\n\n159. A thirteenth I know, | if a thane full young\nWith water I sprinkle well;\nHe shall not fall, | though he fares mid the host,\nNor sink beneath the swords.\n\n160. A fourteenth I know, | if fain I would name\nTo men the mighty gods;\nAll know I well | of the gods and elves,\nFew be the fools know this.\n\n161. A fifteenth I know, | that before the doors\nOf Delling sang Thjothrörir the dwarf;\nMight he sang for the gods, | and glory for elves,\nAnd wisdom for Hroptatyr wise.\n\n162. A sixteenth I know, | if I seek delight\nTo win from a maiden wise;\nThe mind I turn | of the white-armed maid,\nAnd thus change all her thoughts.\n\n163. A seventeenth I know, | so that seldom shall go\nA maiden young from me;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n164. Long these songs | thou shalt, Loddfafnir,\nSeek in vain to sing;\nYet good it were | if thou mightest get them,\nWell, if thou wouldst them learn,\nHelp, if thou hadst them.\n\n165. An eighteenth I know, | that ne'er will I tell\nTo maiden or wife of man,--\nThe best is what none | but one's self doth know,\nSo comes the end of the songs,--\nSave only to her | in whose arms I lie,\nOr who else my sister is."
