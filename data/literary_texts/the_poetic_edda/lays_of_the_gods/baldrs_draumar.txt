	text = "~<Baldr's Dreams~>\n\n1. Once were the gods together met,\nAnd the goddesses came and council held,\nAnd the far-famed ones the truth would find,\nWhy baleful dreams to Baldr had come.\n\n2. Then Othin rose, the enchanter old,\nAnd the saddle he laid on Sleipnir's back;\nThence rode he down to Niflhel deep,\nAnd the hound he met that came from hell.\n\n3. Bloody he was on his breast before,\nAt the father of magic he howled from afar;\nForward rode Othin, the earth resounded\nTill the house so high of Hel he reached.\n\n4. Then Othin rode to the eastern door,\nThere, he knew well, was the wise-woman's grave;\nMagic he spoke and mighty charms,\nTill spell-bound she rose, and in death she spoke:\n\n5. \"What is the man, to me unknown,\nThat has made me travel the troublous road?\nI was snowed on with snow, and smitten with rain,\nAnd drenched with dew; long was I dead.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n6. \"Vegtam my name, I am Valtam's son;\nSpeak thou of hell, for of heaven I know:\nFor whom are the benches bright with rings,\nAnd the platforms gay bedecked with gold?\"\n\n<i>The Wise-Woman spake:</i>\n7. \"Here for Baldr the mead is brewed,\nThe shining drink, and a shield lies o'er it;\nBut their hope is gone from the mighty gods.\nUnwilling I spake, and now would be still.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n8. \"Wise-woman, cease not! I seek from thee\nAll to know that I fain would ask:\nWho shall the bane of Baldr become,\nAnd steal the life from Othin's son?\"\n\n<i>The Wise-Woman spake:</i>\n9. \"Hoth thither bears the far-famed branch,\nHe shall the bane of Baldr become,\nAnd steal the life from Othin's son.\nUnwilling I spake, and now would be still.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n10. \"Wise-woman, cease not! I seek from thee\nAll to know that I fain would ask:\nWho shall vengeance win for the evil work,\nOr bring to the flames the slayer of Baldr?\"\n\n<i>The Wise-Woman spake:</i>\n11. \"Rind bears Vali in Vestrsalir,\nAnd one night old fights Othin's son;\nHis hands he shall wash not, his hair he shall comb not,\nTill the slayer of Baldr he brings to the flames.\nUnwilling I spake, and now would be still.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n12. \"Wise-woman, cease not! I seek from thee\nAll to know that I fain would ask:\nWhat maidens are they who then shall weep,\nAnd toss to the sky the yards of the sails?\"\n\n<i>The Wise-Woman spake:</i>\n13. \"Vegtam thou art not, as erstwhile I thought;\nOthin thou art, the enchanter old.\"\n\n<i>Othin spake:</i>\n\"No wise-woman art thou, nor wisdom hast;\nOf giants three the mother art thou.\"\n\n<i>The Wise-Woman spake:</i>\n14. \"Home ride, Othin, be ever proud;\nFor no one of men shall seek me more\nTill Loki wanders loose from his bonds,\nAnd to the last strife the destroyers come.\""
