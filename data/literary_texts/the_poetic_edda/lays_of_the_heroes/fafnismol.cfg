		text = "[i]The Ballad of Fafnir[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe so-called [i]Fafnismol[/i], contained in full in the [i]Codex[/i] [i]Regius[/i], where it immediately follows the [i]Reginsmol[/i] without any indication of a break, is quoted by Snorri in the [i]Gylfaginning[/i] (stanza 13) and the [i]Skaldskaparmal[/i] (stanzas 32 and 33), and stanzas 6, 3, and 4 appear in the [i]Sverrissaga[/i]. Although the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] does not actually quote any of the stanzas, it gives a very close prose parallel to the whole poem in chapters 18 and 19.\n\nThe general character of the [i]Fafnismol[/i], and its probable relation to the [i]Reginsmol[/i] and the [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i], have been discussed in the introductory note to the [i]Reginsmol[/i]. While it is far more nearly a unit than the [i]Reginsmol[/i], it shows many of the same characteristics. It has the same mixture of stanza forms, although in this case only nine stanzas (32-33, 35-36 and 40-44) vary from the normal Ljothahattr measure. It shows, though to a much less marked extent, the same tendency to introduce passages from extraneous sources, such as the question-and-answer passage in stanzas 11-15. At the same time, in this instance it is quite clear that one distinct poem, including probably stanzas 1-10, 16-23, 25-31, and 34-39, underlay the compilation which we here have. This may, perhaps, have been a long poem (not, however, the \"Lone' Sigurth Lay; see introductory note to [i]Brot[/i] [i]af[/i] [i]Sigurtharkvithu[/i]) dealing with the Regin-Fafnir-Sigurth-Brynhild story, and including, besides most of the [i]Fafnismol[/i], stanzas 1-4 and 6-11 of the [i]Reginsmol[/i] and part of the so-called [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i], together with much that has been lost. The original poem may, on the other hand, have confined itself to the Fafnir episode. In any case, and while the extant [i]Fafnismol[/i] can be spoken of as a distinct poem far more justly than the [i]Reginsmol[/i], there is still no indication that the compiler regarded it as a poem by itself. His prose notes run on without a break, and the verses simply cover a dramatic episode in Sigurth's early life. The fact that the work of compilation has been done more intelligently than in the case of the [i]Reginsmol[/i] seems to have resulted chiefly from the compiler's having been familiar with longer consecutive verse passages dealing with the Fafnir episode."

		text = "The [i]Reginsmol[/i] is little more than a clumsy mosaic, but in the [i]Fafnismol[/i] it is possible to distinguish between the main substance of the poem and the interpolations.\n\nHere, as in the [i]Reginsmol[/i], there is very little that bespeaks the German origin of the Sigurth story. Sigurth's winning of the treasure is in itself undoubtedly a part of the earlier southern legend, but the manner in which he does it is thoroughly Norse. Moreover, the concluding section, which points toward the finding of the sleeping Brynhild, relates entirely to the northern Valkyrie, the warrior-maiden punished by Othin, and not at all to the southern Brynhild the daughter of Buthli. The [i]Fafnismol[/i] is, however, sharply distinguished from the [i]Reginsmol[/i] by showing no clear traces of the Helgi tradition, although a part of the bird song (stanzas 40-44, in Fornyrthislag form, as distinct from the body of the poem) sounds suspiciously like the bird passage in the beginning of the [i]Helgakvitha[/i] [i]Hjorvarthssonar[/i]. Regarding the general relations of the various sets of traditions in shaping the story of Sigurth, see the introductory note to [i]Gripisspo[/i].\n\nThe [i]Fafnismol[/i], together with a part of the [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i], has indirectly become the best known of all the Eddic poems, for the reason that Wagner used it, with remarkably little change of outline, as the basis for his \"Siegfried.\"\n\n__________________\n\nSigurth and Regin went up to the Gnitaheith, and found there the track that Fafnir made when he crawled to water. Then Sigurth made a great trench across the path, and took his place therein. When Fafnir crawled from his gold, he blew out venom, and it ran down from above on Sigurth's head. But when Fafnir crawled over the trench, then Sigurth thrust his sword into his body\n\n[[i]Prose[/i]. The prose follows the concluding prose passage of the [i]Reginsmol[/i] without any interruption; the heading \"Of Fafnir's Death\" is written in the manuscript very faintly just before stanza 1. [i]Gnitaheith[/i]: cf. [i]Gripisspo[/i], ii and note. [i]Fafnir[/i]: Regin's brother: cf. [i]Reginsmol[/i], prose after stanza 14. [i]Venom[/i]: in the [i]Volsungasaga[/i]]"

He said:\n\n2. \"The Noble Hart | my name, and I go\nA motherless man abroad;\nFather I had not, | as others have,\nAnd lonely ever I live.\"\n\n[it was the blood, and not the venom, that poured down on Sigurth's head. Sigurth was much worried about this danger, and before he dug the trench asked Regin what would happen if the dragon's blood overcame him. Regin thereupon taunted him with cowardice (Sigurth refers to this taunt in stanza 30, but the stanza embodying it has disappeared). After Sigurth had dug his trench, an old man (Othin, of course) appeared and advised him to dig other trenches to carry off the blood, which he did, thereby escaping harm.\n\n1.

It is also far from clear how many birds are speaking. The manuscript numbers II, III, and IV in the margin with numerals; the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] makes a different bird speak each time. There are almost as many guesses as there are editions. I suspect that in the original poem there was one bird, speaking stanzas 34 and 37. Stanza 38 is little more, than a repetition of stanza 34, and may well have been a later addition. As for the stanzas in Fornyrthislag (32-53 and 35-36), they apparently come from another poem, in which several birds speak (cf. \"we sisters\" in stanza 35). This may be the same poem from which stanzas 40-44 were taken, as well as some of the Fornyrthislag stanzas in the [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i].\n\n34.

Then Sigurth heard what the nut-hatch said:\n\n40. \"Bind, Sigurth, the golden | rings together,\nNot kingly is it | aught to fear;\nI know a maid, | there is none so fair,\nRich in gold, | if thou mightest get her.\n\n41. \"Green the paths | that to Gjuki lead,\n\n[40. Neither the manuscript nor any of the editions suggest the existence of more than one bird in stanzas 40-44. it seems to me, however, that there are not only two birds, but two distinct stories. Stanzas 40-41 apply solely to Guthrun, and suggest that Sigurth will go straight to Gunnar's hall. Stanzas 42-44, on the other hand, apply solely to Brynhild, and indicate that Sigurth will find her before he visits the Gjukungs. The confusion which existed between these two versions of the story, and which involved a fundamental difference in the final working out of Brynhild's revenge, is commented on in the note on [i]Gripisspo[/i], 13. In the present passage it is possible that two birds are speaking, each reflecting one version of the story; it seems even more likely that one speech or the other (40-41 or 42-44) reflects the original form of the narrative, the other having been added, either later or from another poem. In the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] the whole passage is condensed into a few words by one bird: \"Wiser were it if he should then ride up on Hindarfjoll, where Brynhild sleeps, and there would he get much wisdom.\" The Guthrun-bird does not appear at all.\n\n41.
