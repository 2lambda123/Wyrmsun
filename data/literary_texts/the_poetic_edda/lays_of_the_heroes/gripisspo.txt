	text = "~<Gripir's Prophecy~>\n\nGripir was the name of Eylimi's son, the brother of Hjordis; he ruled over lands and was of all men the wisest and most forward-seeing. Sigurth once was riding alone and came to Gripir's hall. Sigurth was easy to recognize; he found out in front of the hall a man whose name was Geitir. Then Sigurth questioned him and asked:\n\n1. \"Who is it has this dwelling here,\nOr what do men call the people's king?\"\n<i>Geitir spake:</i>\n\"Gripir the name of the chieftain good\nWho holds the folk and the firm-ruled land.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n2. \"Is the king all-knowing now within,\nWill the monarch come with me to speak?\nA man unknown his counsel needs,\nAnd Gripir fain I soon would find.\"\n\n<i>Geitir spake:</i>\n3. \"The ruler glad of Geitir will ask\nWho seeks with Gripir speech to have.\"\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n\"Sigurth am I, and Sigmund's son,\nAnd Hjordis the name of the hero's mother.\"\n\n4. Then Geitir went and to Gripir spake:\n\"A stranger comes and stands without;\nLofty he is to look upon,\nAnd, prince, thyself he fain would see.\"\n\n5. From the hall the ruler of heroes went,\nAnd greeted well the warrior come:\n\"Sigurth, welcome long since had been thine;\nNow, Geitir, shalt thou Grani take.\"\n\n6. Then of many things they talked,\nWhen thus the men so wise had met.\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n\"To me, if thou knowest, my mother's brother,\nSay what life will Sigurth's be.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n7. \"Of men thou shalt be on earth the mightiest,\nAnd higher famed than all the heroes;\nFree of gold-giving, slow to flee,\nNoble to see, and sage in speech.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n8. \"Monarch wise, now more I ask;\nTo Sigurth say, if thou thinkest to see,\nWhat first will chance of my fortune fair,\nWhen hence I go from out thy home?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n9. \"First shalt thou, prince, thy father avenge,\nAnd Eylimi, their ills requiting;\nThe hardy sons of Hunding thou\nSoon shalt fell, and victory find.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n10. \"Noble king, my kinsman, say\nThy meaning true, for our minds we speak:\nFor Sigurth mighty deeds dost see,\nThe highest beneath the heavens all?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n11. \"The fiery dragon alone thou shalt fight\nThat greedy lies at Gnitaheith;\nThou shalt be of Regin and Fafnir both\nThe slayer; truth doth Gripir tell thee.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n12. \"Rich shall I be if battles I win\nWith such as these, as now thou sayest;\nForward look, and further tell:\nWhat the life that I shall lead?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n13. \"Fafnir's den thou then shalt find,\nAnd all his treasure fair shalt take;\nGold shalt heap on Grani's back,\nAnd, proved in fight, to Gjuki fare.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n14. \"To the warrior now in words. so wise,\nMonarch noble, more shalt tell;\nI am Gjuki's guest, and thence I go:\nWhat the life that I shall lead?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n15. \"On the rocks there sleeps the ruler's daughter,\nFair in armor, since Helgi fell;\nThou shalt cut with keen-edged sword,\nAnd cleave the byrnie with Fafnir's killer.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n16. \"The mail-coat is broken, the maiden speaks,\nThe woman who from sleep has wakened;\nWhat says the maid to Sigurth then\nThat happy fate to the hero brings?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n17. \"Runes to the warrior will she tell,\nAll that men may ever seek,\nAnd teach thee to speak in all men's tongues,\nAnd life with health; thou'rt happy, king!\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n18. \"Now is it ended, the knowledge is won,\nAnd ready I am forth thence to ride;\nForward look and further tell:\nWhat the life that I shall lead?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n19. \"Then to Heimir's home thou comest,\nAnd glad shalt be the guest of the king;\nEnded, Sigurth, is all I see,\nNo further aught of Gripir ask.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n20. \"Sorrow brings me the word thou sayest,\nFor, monarch, forward further thou seest;\nSad the grief for Sigurth thou knowest,\nYet nought to me, Gripir, known wilt make.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n21. \"Before me lay in clearest light\nAll of thy youth for mine eyes to see;\nNot rightly can I wise be called,\nNor forward-seeing; my wisdom is fled.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n22. \"No man, Gripir, on earth I know\nWho sees the future as far as thou;\nHide thou nought, though hard it be,\nAnd base the deeds that I shall do.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n23. \"With baseness never thy life is burdened,\nHero noble, hold that sure;\nLofty as long as the world shall live,\nBattle-bringer, thy name shall be.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n24. \"Nought could seem worse, but now must part\nThe prince and Sigurth, since so it is,\nMy road I ask,-- the future lies open,--\nMighty one, speak, my mother's brother.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n25. \"Now to Sigurth all shall I say,\nFor to this the warrior bends my will;\nThou knowest well that I will not lie,--\nA day there is when thy death is doomed.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n26. \"No scorn I know for the noble king,\nBut counsel good from Gripir I seek;\nWell will I know, though evil awaits,\nWhat Sigurth may before him see.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n27. \"A maid in Heimir's home there dwells,\nBrynhild her name to men is known,\nDaughter of Buthli, the doughty king,\nAnd Heimir fosters the fearless maid.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n28. \"What is it to me, though the maiden be\nSo fair, and of Heimir the fosterling is?\nGripir, truth to me shalt tell,\nFor all of fate before me thou seest.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n29. \"Of many a joy the maiden robs thee,\nFair to see, whom Heimir fosters;\nSleep thou shalt find not, feuds thou shalt end not,\nNor seek out men, if the maid thou seest not.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n30. \"What may be had for Sigurth's healing?\nSay now, Gripir, if see thou canst;\nMay I buy the maid with the marriage-price,\nThe daughter fair of the chieftain famed?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n31. \"Ye twain shall all the oaths then swear\nThat bind full fast; few shall ye keep;\nOne night when Gjuki's guest thou hast been,\nWill Heimir's fosterling fade from thy mind.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n32. \"What sayst thou, Gripir? give me the truth,\nDoes fickleness hide in the hero's heart?\nCan it be that troth I break with the maid,\nWith her I believed I loved so dear?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n33. \"Tricked by another, prince, thou art,\nAnd the price of Grimhild's wiles thou must pay;\nFain of thee for the fair-haired maid,\nHer daughter, she is, and she drags thee down.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n34. \"Might I with Gunnar kinship make,\nAnd Guthrun win to be my wife,\nWell the hero wedded would be,\nIf my treacherous deed would trouble me not.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n35. \"Wholly Grimhild thy heart deceives,\nShe will bid thee go and Brynhild woo\nFor Gunnar's wife, the lord of the Goths;\nAnd the prince's mother thy promise shall win.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n36. \"Evil waits me, well I see it,\nAnd gone is Sigurth's wisdom good,\nIf I shall woo for another to win\nThe maiden fair that so fondly I loved.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n37. \"Ye three shall all the oaths then take,\nGunnar and Hogni, and, hero, thou;\nYour forms ye shall change, as forth ye tare,\nGunnar and thou; for Gripir lies not.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n38. \"How meanest thou? Why make we the change\nOf shape and form as forth we fare?\nThere must follow another falsehood\nGrim in all ways; speak on, Gripir!\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n39. \"The form of Gunnar and shape thou gettest,\nBut mind and voice thine own remain;\nThe hand of the fosterling noble of Heimir\nNow dost thou win, and none can prevent.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n40. \"Most evil it seems, and men will say\nBase is Sigurth that so he did;\nNot of my will shall I cheat with wiles\nThe heroes' maiden whom noblest I hold.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n41. \"Thou dwellest, leader lofty of men,\nWith the maid as if thy mother she were;\nLofty as long as the world shall live,\nRuler of men, thy name shall remain.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n42. \"Shall Gunnar have a goodly wife,\nFamed among men,-- speak forth now, Gripir!\nAlthough at my side three nights she slept,\nThe warrior's bride? Such ne'er has been.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n43. \"The marriage draught will be drunk for both,\nFor Sigurth and Gunnar, in Gjuki's hall;\nYour forms ye change, when home ye fare,\nBut the mind of each to himself remains.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n44. \"Shall the kinship new thereafter come\nTo good among us? Tell me, Gripir!\nTo Gunnar joy shall it later give,\nOr happiness send for me myself?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n45. \"Thine oaths remembering, silent thou art,\nAnd dwellest with Guthrun in wedlock good;\nBut Brynhild shall deem she is badly mated,\nAnd wiles she seeks, herself to avenge.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n46. \"What may for the bride requital be,\nThe wife we won with subtle wiles?\nFrom me she has the oaths I made,\nAnd kept not long; they gladdened her little.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n47. \"To Gunnar soon his bride will say\nThat ill didst thou thine oath fulfill,\nWhen the goodly king, the son of Gjuki,\nWith all his heart the hero trusted.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n48. \"What sayst thou, Gripir? give me the truth!\nAm I guilty so as now is said,\nOr lies does the far-famed queen put forth\nOf me and herself? Yet further speak.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n49. \"In wrath and grief full little good\nThe noble bride shall work thee now;\nNo shame thou gavest the goodly one,\nThough the monarch's wife with wiles didst cheat.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n50. \"Shall Gunnar the wise to the woman's words,\nAnd Gotthorm and Hogni, then give heed?\nShall Gjuki's sons, now tell me, Gripir,\nRedden their blades with their kinsman's blood?\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n51. \"Heavy it lies on Guthrun's heart,\nWhen her brothers all shall bring thee death;\nNever again shall she happiness know,\nThe woman so fair; 'tis Grimhild's work.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n52. \"Now fare thee well! our fates we shun not;\nAnd well has Gripir answered my wish;\nMore of joy to me wouldst tell\nOf my life to come if so thou couldst.\"\n\n<i>Gripir spake:</i>\n53. \"Ever remember, ruler of men,\nThat fortune lies in the hero's life;\nA nobler man shall never live\nBeneath the sun than Sigurth shall seem.\""
