	text = "~<The Greenland Ballad of Atli~>\n\n1. There are many who know how of old did men\nIn counsel gather; little good did they get;\nIn secret they plotted, it was sore for them later,\nAnd for Gjuki's sons, whose trust they deceived.\n\n2. Fate grew for the princes, to death they were given;\nIll counsel was Atli's, though keenness he had;\nHe felled his staunch bulwark, his own sorrow fashioned,\nSoon a message he sent that his kinsmen should seek him.\n\n3. Wise was the woman, she fain would use wisdom,\nShe saw well what meant all they said in secret;\nFrom her heart it was hid how help she might render,\nThe sea they should sail, while herself she should go not.\n\n4. Runes did she fashion, but false Vingi made them,\nThe speeder of hatred, ere to give them he sought;\nThen soon fared the warriors whom Atli had sent,\nAnd to Limafjord came, to the home of the kings.\n\n5. They were kindly with ale, and fires they kindled,\nThey thought not of craft from the guests who had come;\nThe gifts did they take that the noble one gave them,\nOn the pillars they hung them, no fear did they harbor.\n\n6. Forth did Kostbera, wife of Hogni, then come,\nFull kindly she was, and she welcomed them both;\nAnd glad too was Glaumvor, the wife of Gunnar,\nShe knew well to care for the needs of the guests.\n\n7. Then Hogni they asked if more eager he were,\nFull clear was the guile, if on guard they had been;\nThen Gunnar made promise, if Hogni would go,\nAnd Hogni made answer as the other counseled.\n\n8. Then the famed ones brought mead, and fair was the feast,\nFull many were the horns, till the men had drunk deep;\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nThen the mates made ready their beds for resting.\n\n9. Wise was Kostbera, and cunning in rune-craft,\nThe letters would she read by the light of the fire;\nBut full quickly her tongue to her palate clave,\nSo strange did they seem that their meaning she saw not.\n\n10. Full soon then his bed came Hogni to seek,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nThe clear-souled one dreamed, and her dream she kept not,\nTo the warrior the wise one spake when she wakened:\n\n11. \"Thou wouldst go hence, Hogni, but heed my counsel,--\nKnown to few are the runes,-- and put off thy faring;\nI have read now the runes that thy sister wrote,\nAnd this time the bright one did not bid thee to come.\n\n12. \"Full much do I wonder, nor well can I see,\nWhy the woman wise so wildly hath written;\nBut to me it seems that the meaning beneath\nIs that both shall be slain if soon ye shall go.\nBut one rune she missed, or else others have marred it.\"\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n13. \"All women are fearful; not so do I feel,\nIll I seek not to find till I soon must avenge it;\nThe king now will give us the glow-ruddy gold;\nI never shall fear, though of dangers I know.\"\n\n<i>Kostbera spake:</i>\n14. \"In danger ye fare, if forth ye go thither,\nNo welcoming friendly this time shall ye find;\nFor I dreamed now, Hogni, and nought will I hide,\nFull evil thy faring, if rightly I fear.\n\n15. \"Thy bed-covering saw I in the flames burning,\nAnd the fire burst high through the walls of my home.\"\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n\"Yon garment of linen lies little of worth,\nIt will soon be burned, so thou sawest the bed-cover.\"\n\n<i>Kostbera spake:</i>\n16. \"A bear saw I enter, the pillars he broke,\nAnd he brandished his claws so that craven we were;\nWith his mouth seized he many, and nought was our might,\nAnd loud was the tumult, not little it was.\"\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n17. \"Now a storm is brewing, and wild it grows swiftly,\nA dream of an ice-bear means a gale from the east.\"\n\n<i>Kostbera spake</i>:\n18. \"An eagle I saw flying from the end through the house,\nOur fate must be bad, for with blood he sprinkled us;\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nFrom the evil I fear that 'twas Atli's spirit.\"\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n19. \"They will slaughter soon, and so blood do we see,\nOft oxen it means when of eagles one dreams;\nTrue is Atli's heart, whatever thou dreamest.\"\nThen silent they were, and nought further they said.\n\n20. The high-born ones wakened, and like speech they had,\nThen did Glaumvor tell how in terror she dreamed,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . . Gunnar two roads they should go.\n\n<i>Glaumvor spake:</i>\n21. \"A gallows saw I ready, thou didst go to thy hanging,\nThy flesh serpents ate, and yet living I found thee;\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nThe gods' doom descended; now say what it boded.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n22. \"A sword drawn bloody from thy garments I saw,--\nSuch a dream is hard o a husband to tell,--\nA spear stood, methought, through thy body thrust,\nAnd at head and feet the wolves were howling.\"\n\n<i>Gunnar spake:</i>\n23. \"The hounds are running, loud their barking is heard,\nOft hounds' clamor follows the flying of spears.\"\n\n<i>Glaumvor spake:</i>\n24. \"A river the length of the hall saw I run,\nFull swiftly it roared, o'er the benches it swept;\nO'er the feet did it break of ye brothers twain,\nThe water would yield not; some meaning there was.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n25. \"I dreamed that by night came dead women hither,\nSad were their garments, and thee were they seeking;\nThey bade thee come swiftly forth to their benches,\nAnd nothing, methinks, could the Norns avail thee. \"\n\n<i>Gunnar spake:</i>\n26. \"Too late is thy speaking, for so is it settled\nFrom the faring I turn not, the going is fixed,\nThough likely it is that our lives shall be short.\"\n\n27. Then bright shone the morning, the men all were ready,\nThey said, and yet each would the other hold back;\nFive were the warriors, and their followers all\nBut twice as many,-- their minds knew not wisdom.\n\n28. Snævar and Solar, they were sons of Hogni,\nOrkning was he called who came with the others,\nBlithe was the shield-tree, the brother of Kostbera;\nThe fair-decked ones followed, till the fjord divided them,\nFull hard did they plead, but the others would hear not.\n\n29. Then did Glaumvor speak forth, the wife of Gunnar,\nTo Vingi she said that which wise to her seemed:\n\"I know not if well thou requitest our welcome,\nFull ill was thy coming if evil shall follow.\"\n\n30. Then did Vingi swear, and full glib was his speech,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\"May giants now take me if lies I have told ye,\nAnd the gallows if hostile thought did I have.\"\n\n31. Then did Bera speak forth, and fair was her thought,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\"May ye sail now happy, and victory have,\nTo fare as I bid ye, may nought your way bar.\"\n\n32. Then Hogni made answer,-- dear held he his kin,-\n\"Take courage, ye wise ones, whatsoever may come;\nThough many may speak, yet is evil oft mighty,\nAnd words avail little to lead one homeward.\"\n\n33. They tenderly looked till each turned on his way,\nThen with changing fate were their farings divided.\n\n34. Full stoutly they rowed, and the keel clove asunder,\nTheir backs strained at the oars, and their strength was fierce;\nThe oar-loops were burst, the thole-pins, were broken,\nNor the ship made they fast ere from her they fared.\n\n35. Not long was it after-- the end must I tell--\nThat the home they beheld that Buthli once had;\nLoud the gates resounded when Hogni smote them;\nVingi spake then a word that were better unsaid:\n\n36. \"Go ye far from the house, for false is its entrance,\nSoon shall I burn you, ye are swiftly smitten;\nI bade ye come fairly, but falseness was under,\nNow bide ye afar while your gallows I fashion.\"\n\n37. Then Hogni made answer, his heart yielded little,\nAnd nought did he fear that his fate held in store:\n\"Seek not to affright us, thou shalt seldom succeed;\nIf thy words are more, then the worse grows thy fate.\"\n\n38. Then Vingi did they smite, and they sent him to hell,\nWith their axes they clove him while the death rattle came.\n\n39. Atli summoned his men, in mail-coats they hastened,\nAll ready they came, and between was the courtyard.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n40. Then came they to words, and full wrathful they were:\n\"Long since did we plan how soon we might slay you.\"\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n41. \"Little it matters if long ye have planned it;\nFor unarmed do ye wait, and one have we felled,\nWe smote him to hell, of your host was he once.\"\n\n42. Then wild was their anger when all heard his words;\nTheir fingers were swift on their bowstrings to seize,\nFull sharply they shot, by their shields were they guarded.\n\n43. In the house came the word how the heroes with out\nFought in front of the hall; they heard a thrall tell it;\nGrim then was Guthrun, the grief when she heard,\nWith necklaces fair, and she flung them all from her,\n(The silver she hurled so the rings burst asunder.)\n\n44. Then out did she go, she flung open the doors,\nAll fearless she went, and the guests did she welcome;\nTo the Niflungs she went-- her last greeting it was,--\nIn her speech truth was clear, and much would she speak.\n\n45. \"For your safety I sought that at home ye should stay;\nNone escapes his fate, so ye hither must fare.\"\nFull wisely she spake, if yet peace they might win,\nBut to nought would they hearken, and \"No\" said they all.\n\n46. Then the high-born one saw that hard was their battle,\nIn fierceness of heart she flung off her mantle;\nHer naked sword grasped she her kin's lives to guard,\nNot gentle her hands in the hewing of battle.\n\n47. Then the daughter of Gjuki two warriors smote down,\nAtli's brother she slew, and forth then they bore him;\n(So fiercely she fought that his feet she clove off;)\nAnother she smote so that never he stood,\nTo hell did she send him,-- her hands trembled never.\n\n48. Full wide was the fame of the battle they fought,\n'Twas the greatest of deeds of the sons of Gjuki;\nMen say that the Niflungs, while themselves they were living,\nWith their swords fought mightily, mail-coats they sundered,\nAnd helms did they hew, as their hearts were fearless.\n\n49. All the morning they fought until midday shone,\n(All the dusk as well and the dawning of day,)\nWhen the battle was ended, the field flowed with blood;\nEre they fell, eighteen of their foemen were slain,\nBy the two sons of Bera and her brother as well.\n\n50. Then the warrior spake, and wild was his anger:\n\"This is evil to see, and thy doing is all;\nOnce we were thirty, we thanes, keen for battle,\nNow eleven are left, and great is our lack.\n\n51. \"There were five of us brothers when Buthli we lost,\nNow Hel has the half, and two smitten lie here;\nA great kinship had I,-- the truth may I hide not,--\nFrom a wife bringing slaughter small joy could I win.\n\n52. We lay seldom together since to me thou wast given,\nNow my kin all are gone, of my gold am I robbed;\nNay, and worst, thou didst send my sister to hell.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n53. \"Hear me now, Atli! the first evil was thine;\nMy mother didst thou take, and for gold didst murder her,\nMy sister's daughter thou didst starve in a prison.\nA jest does it seem that thy sorrow thou tellest,\nAnd good do I find it that grief to thee comes.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n54. \"Go now, ye warriors, and make greater the grief\nOf the woman so fair, for fain would I see it;\nSo fierce be thy warring that Guthrun shall weep,\nI would gladly behold her happiness lost.\n\n55. \"Seize ye now Hogni, and with knives shall ye hew him,\nHis heart shall ye cut out, this haste ye to do;\nAnd grim-hearted Gunnar shall ye bind on the gallows,\nSwift shall ye do it, to serpents now cast him.\"\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n56. \"Do now as thou wilt, for glad I await it,\nBrave shalt thou find me, I have faced worse before;\nWe held thee at bay while whole we were fighting,\nNow with wounds are we spent, so thy will canst thou work.\"\n\n57. Then did Beiti speak, he was Atli's steward:\n\"Let us seize now Hjalli, and Hogni spare we!\nLet us fell the sluggard, he is fit for death,\nHe has lived too long, and lazy men call him.\"\n\n58. Afraid was the pot-watcher, he fled here and yon,\nAnd crazed with his terror he climbed in the corners:\n\"Ill for me is this fighting, if I pay for your fierceness,\nAnd sad is the day to die leaving my swine\nAnd all the fair victuals that of old did I have.\"\n\n59. They seized Buthli's cook, and they came with the knife,\nThe frightened thrall howled ere the edge did he feel;\nHe was willing, he cried, to dung well the court yard,\nDo the basest of work, if spare him they would;\nFull happy were Hjalli if his life he might have.\n\n60. Then fain was Hogni-- there are few would do thus--\nTo beg for the slave that safe hence he should go;\n\"I would find it far better this knife-play to feel,\nWhy must we all hark to this howling longer?\"\n\n61. Then the brave one they seized; to the warriors bold\nNo chance was there left to delay his fate longer;\nLoud did Hogni laugh, all the sons of day heard him,\nSo valiant he was that well he could suffer.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n62. A harp Gunnar seized, with his toes he smote it\nSo well did he strike that the women all wept,\nAnd the men, when clear they heard it, lamented;\nFull noble was his song, the rafters burst asunder.\n\n63. Then the heroes died ere the day was yet come;\nTheir fame did they leave ever lofty to live.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n64. Full mighty seemed Atli as o'er them he stood,\nThe wise one he blamed, and his words reproached her:\n\"It is morning, Guthrun; now thy dear ones dost miss,\nBut the blame is part thine that thus it has chanced.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n65. \"Thou art joyous, Atli, for of evil thou tellest,\nBut sorrow is thine if thou mightest all see;\nThy heritage heavy here can I tell thee,\nSorrow never thou losest unless I shall die.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n66. \"Not free of guilt am I; a way shall I find\nThat is better by far,-- oft the fairest we shunned;--\nWith slaves I console thee, with gems fair to see,\nAnd with silver snow-white, as thyself thou shalt choose.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n67. \"No hope shall this give thee, thy gifts I shall take not,\nRequital I spurned when my sorrows were smaller;\nOnce grim did I seem, but now greater my grimness,\nThere was nought seemed too hard while Hogni was living.\n\n68. \"Our childhood did we have in a single house,\nWe played many a game, in the grove did we grow;\nThen did Grimhild give us gold and necklaces,\nThou shalt ne'er make amends for my brother's murder,\nNor ever shalt win me to think it was well.\n\n69. \"But the fierceness of men rules the fate of women,\nThe tree-top bows low if bereft of its leaves,\nThe tree bends over if the roots are cleft under it;\nNow mayest thou, Atli, o'er all things here rule.\"\n\n70. Full heedless the warrior was that he trusted her,\nSo clear was her guile if on guard he had been;\nBut crafty was Guthrun, with cunning she spake,\nHer glance she made pleasant, with two shields she played.\n\n71. The beer then she brought for her brothers' death feast,\nAnd a feast Atli made for his followers dead\nNo more did they speak, the mead was made ready,\nSoon the men were gathered with mighty uproar.\n\n72. Thus bitterly planned she, and Buthli's race threatened,\nAnd terrible vengeance on her husband would take;\nThe little ones called she, on a block she laid them;\nAfraid were the proud ones, but their tears did not fall;\nTo their mother's arms went they, and asked what she would.\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n73. \"Nay, ask me no more! You both shall I murder,\nFor long have I wished your lives to steal from you.\n\n<i>The boys spake:</i>\n\"Slay thy boys as thou wilt, for no one may bar it,\nShort the angry one's peace if all thou shalt do.\"\n\n74. Then the grim one slew both of the brothers young,\nFull hard was her deed when their heads she smote off;\nFain was Atli to know whither now they were gone,\nThe boys from their sport, for nowhere he spied them.\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n75. \"My fate shall I seek, all to Atli saying,\nThe daughter of Grimhild the deed from thee hides not;\nNo joy thou hast, Atli, if all thou shalt hear,\nGreat sorrow didst wake when my brothers thou slewest.\n\n76. '1 have seldom slept since the hour they were slain,\nBaleful were my threats, now I bid thee recall them;\nThou didst say it was morning,-- too well I remember,--\nNow is evening come, and this question thou askest.\n\n77. \"Now both of thy sons thou hast lost . . . .\n . . . . . as thou never shouldst do;\nThe skulls of thy boys thou as beer-cups didst have,\nAnd the draught that I made thee was mixed with their blood.\n\n78. 'I cut out their hearts, on a spit I cooked them,\nI came to thee with them, and calf's flesh I called them;\nAlone didst thou eat them, nor any didst leave,\nThou didst greedily bite, and thy teeth were busy.\n\n79. \"Of thy sons now thou knowest; few suffer more sorrow;\nMy guilt have I told, fame it never shall give me.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n80. \"Grim wast thou, Guthrun, in so grievous a deed,\nMy draught with the blood of thy boys to mingle;\nThou hast slain thine own kin, most ill it be seemed thee,\nAnd little for me twixt my sorrows thou leavest.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n81. \"Still more would I seek to slay thee thyself,\nEnough ill comes seldom to such as thou art;\nThou didst folly of old, such that no one shall find\nIn the whole world of men a match for such madness.\nNow this that of late we learned hast thou added,\nGreat evil hast grasped, and thine own death feast made.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n82. \"With fire shall they burn thee, and first shall they stone thee,\nSo then hast thou earned what thou ever hast sought for.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n\"Such woes for thyself shalt thou say in the morning,\nFrom a finer death I to another light fare.\"\n\n83. Together they sat and full grim were their thoughts,\nUnfriendly their words, and no joy either found;\nIn Hniflung grew hatred, great plans did he have,\nTo Guthrun his anger against Atli was told.\n\n84. To her heart came ever the fate of Hogni,\nShe told him 'twere well if he vengeance should win;\nSo was Atli slain,-- 'twas not slow to await,--\nHogni's son slew him, and Guthrun herself.\n\n85. Then the warrior spake, as from slumber he wakened,\nSoon he knew for his wounds would the bandage do nought:\n\"Now the truth shalt thou say: who has slain Buthli's son?\nFull sore am I smitten, nor hope can I see.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n86. \"Ne'er her deed from thee hides the daughter of Grimhild,\nI own to the guilt that is ending thy life,\nAnd the son of Hogni; 'tis so thy wounds bleed.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n\"To murder hast thou fared, though foul it must seem;\nIll thy friend to betray who trusted thee well.\n\n87. \"Not glad went I hence thy hand to seek, Guthrun,\nIn thy widowhood famed, but haughty men found thee;\nMy belief did not lie, as now we have learned;\nI brought thee home hither, and a host of men with us.\n\n88. \"Most noble was all when of old we journeyed,\nGreat honor did we have of heroes full worthy;\nOf cattle had we plenty, and greatly we prospered,\nMighty was our wealth, and many received it.\n\n89. \"To the famed one as bride-gift I gave jewels fair,\nI gave thirty slaves, and handmaidens seven;\nThere was honor in such gifts, yet the silver was greater.\n\n90. \"But all to thee was as if nought it were worth,\nWhile the land lay before thee that Buthli had left me;\nThou in secret didst work so the treasure I won not;\nMy mother full oft to sit weeping didst make,\nNo wedded joy found I in fullness of heart.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n91. \"Thou liest now, Atli, though little I heed it;\nIf I seldom was kindly, full cruel wast thou;\nYe brothers fought young, quarrels brought you to battle,\nAnd half went to hell of the sons of thy house,\nAnd all was destroyed that should e'er have done good.\n\n92. \"My two brothers and I were bold in our thoughts,\nFrom the land we went forth, with Sigurth we fared;\nFull swiftly we sailed, each one steering his ship,\nSo our fate sought we e'er till we came to the East.\n\n93. \"First the king did we slay, and the land we seized,\nThe princes did us service, for such was their fear;\nFrom the forest we called them we fain would have guiltless,\nAnd rich made we many who of all were bereft.\n\n94. \"Slain was the Hun-king, soon happiness vanished,\nIn her grief the widow so young sat weeping;\nYet worse seemed the sorrow to seek Atli's house,\nA hero was my husband, and hard was his loss.\n\n95. \"From the Thing thou camst never, for thus have we heard,\nHaving won in thy quarrels, or warriors smitten;\nFull yielding thou wast, never firm was thy will,\nIn silence didst suffer,  . . . . .\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n96. \"Thou liest now, Guthrun, but little of good\nWill it bring to either, for all have we lost;\nBut, Guthrun, yet once be thou kindly of will,\nFor the honor of both, when forth I am home.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n97. \"A ship will I buy, and a bright-hued coffin,\nI will wax well the shroud to wind round thy body,\nFor all will I care as if dear were we ever.\"\n\n98. Then did Atli die, and his heirs' grief doubled;\nThe high-born one did as to him she had promised;\nThen sought Guthrun the wise to go to her death,\nBut for days did she wait, and 'twas long ere she died.\n\n99. Full happy shall he be who such offspring has,\nOr children so gallant, as Gjuki begot;\nForever shall live, and in lands far and wide,\nTheir valor heroic wherever men hear it."
