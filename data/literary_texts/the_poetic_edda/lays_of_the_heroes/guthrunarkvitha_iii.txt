	text = "~<The Third Lay of Guthrun~>\n\nHerkja was the name of a serving-woman of Atli's; she had been his concubine. She told Atli that she had seen Thjothrek and Guthrun both together. Atli was greatly angered thereby. Then Guthrun said:\n\n1. \"What thy sorrow, Atli, Buthli's son?\nIs thy heart heavy-laden? Why laughest thou never?\nIt would better befit the warrior far\nTo speak with men, and me to look on.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n2. \"It troubles me, Guthrun, Gjuki's daughter,\nWhat Herkja here in the hall hath told me,\nThat thou in the bed with Thjothrek liest,\nBeneath the linen in lovers' guise.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n3. \"This shall I with oaths now swear,\nSwear by the sacred stone so white,\nThat nought was there with Thjothmar's son\nThat man or woman may not know.\n\n4. \"Nor ever once did my arms embrace\nThe hero brave, the leader of hosts;\nIn another manner our meeting was,\nWhen our sorrows we in secret told.\n\n5. \"With thirty warriors Thjothrek came,\nNor of all his men doth one remain;\nThou hast murdered my brothers and mail-clad men,\nThou hast murdered all the men of my race.\n\n6. \"Gunnar comes not, Hogni I greet not,\nNo longer I see my brothers loved;\nMy sorrow would Hogni avenge with the sword,\nNow myself for my woes I shall payment win.\n\n7. \"Summon Saxi, the southrons' king,\nFor be the boiling kettle can hallow.\"\nSeven hundred there were in the hall,\nEre the queen her hand in the kettle thrust.\n\n8. To the bottom she reached with hand so bright,\nAnd forth she brought the flashing stones:\n\"Behold, ye warriors, well am I cleared\nOf sin by the kettle's sacred boiling.\"\n\n9. Then Atli's heart in happiness laughed,\nWhen Guthrun's hand unhurt he saw;\n\"Now Herkja shall come the kettle to try,\nShe who grief for Guthrun planned.\"\n\n10. Ne'er saw man sight more sad than this,\nHow burned were the hands of Herkja then;\nIn a bog so foul the maid they flung,\nAnd so was Guthrun's grief requited."
