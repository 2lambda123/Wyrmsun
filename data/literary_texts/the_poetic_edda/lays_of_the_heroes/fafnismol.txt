	text = "~<The Ballad of Fafnir~>\n\nSigurth and Regin went up to the Gnitaheith, and found there the track that Fafnir made when he crawled to water. Then Sigurth made a great trench across the path, and took his place therein. When Fafnir crawled from his gold, he blew out venom, and it ran down from above on Sigurth's head. But when Fafnir crawled over the trench, then Sigurth thrust his sword into his body to the heart. Fafnir writhed and struck out with his head and tail. Sigurth leaped from the trench, and each looked at the other. Fafnir said:\n\n1. \"Youth, oh, youth! of whom then, youth, art thou born?\nSay whose son thou art,\nWho in Fafnir's blood thy bright blade reddened,\nAnd struck thy sword to my heart.\"\n\nSigurth concealed his name because it was believed in olden times that the word of a dying man might have great power if he cursed his foe by his name. He said:\n\n2. \"The Noble Hart my name, and I go\nA motherless man abroad;\nFather I had not, as others have,\nAnd lonely ever I live.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n3. \"If father thou hadst not, as others have,\nBy what wonder wast thou born?\n(Though thy name on the day of my death thou hidest,\nThou knowest now thou dost lie.)\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n4. \"My race, methinks, is unknown to thee,\nAnd so am I myself;\nSigurth my name, and Sigmund's son,\nWho smote thee thus with the sword.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n5. \"Who drove thee on? why wert thou driven\nMy life to make me lose?\nA father brave had the bright-eyed youth,\nFor bold in boyhood thou art.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n6. \"My heart did drive me, my hand fulfilled,\nAnd my shining sword so sharp;\nFew are keen when old age comes,\nWho timid in boyhood be.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n7. \"If thou mightest grow thy friends among,\nOne might see thee fiercely fight;\nBut bound thou art, and in battle taken,\nAnd to fear are prisoners prone.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n8. \"Thou blamest me, Fafnir, that I see from afar\nThe wealth that my father's was;\nNot bound am I, though in battle taken,\nThou hast found that free I live.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n9. \"In all I say dost thou hatred see,\nYet truth alone do I tell;\nThe sounding gold, the glow-red wealth,\nAnd the rings thy bane shall be.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n10. \"Some one the hoard shall ever hold,\nTill the destined day shall come;\nFor a time there is when every man\nShall journey hence to hell.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n11. \"The fate of the Norns before the headland\nThou findest, and doom of a fool;\nIn the water shalt drown if thou row 'gainst the wind,\nAll danger is near to death.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n12. \"Tell me then, Fafnir, for wise thou art famed,\nAnd much thou knowest now:\nWho are the Norns who are helpful in need,\nAnd the babe from the mother bring?\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n13. \"Of many births the Norns must be,\nNor one in race they were;\nSome to gods, others to elves are kin,\nAnd Dvalin's daughters some.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n14. \"Tell me then, Fafnir, for wise thou art famed,\nAnd much thou knowest now:\nHow call they the isle where all the gods\nAnd Surt shall sword-sweat mingle?\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n15. \"Oskopnir is it, where all the gods\nShall seek the play of swords;\nBilrost breaks when they cross the bridge,\nAnd the steeds shall swim in the flood.\n\n16. \"The fear-helm I wore to afright mankind,\nWhile guarding my gold I lay;\nMightier seemed I than any man,\nFor a fiercer never I found.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n17. \"The fear-helm surely no man shields\nWhen he faces a valiant foe;\nOft one finds, when the foe he meets,\nThat he is not the bravest of all.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n18. \"Venom I breathed when bright I lay\nBy the hoard my father had;\n(There was none so mighty as dared to meet me,\nAnd weapons nor wiles I feared.)\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n19. \"Glittering worm, thy hissing was great,\nAnd hard didst show thy heart;\nBut hatred more have the sons of men\nFor him who owns the helm.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n20. \"I counsel thee, Sigurth, heed my speech,\nAnd ride thou homeward hence,\nThe sounding gold, the glow-red wealth,\nAnd the rings thy bane shall be.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n21. \"Thy counsel is given, but go I shall\nTo the gold in the heather hidden;\nAnd, Fafnir, thou with death dost fight,\nLying where Hel shall have thee.\"\n\n<i>Fafnir spake:</i>\n22. \"Regin betrayed me, and thee will betray,\nUs both to death will he bring;\nHis life, methinks, must Fafnir lose,\nFor the mightier man wast thou.\"\n\nRegin had gone to a distance while Sigurth fought Fafnir, and came back while Sigurth was wiping the blood from his sword. Regin said:\n\n23. \"Hail to thee, Sigurth! Thou victory hast,\nAnd Fafnir in fight hast slain;\nOf all the men who tread the earth,\nMost fearless art thou, methinks.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n24. \"Unknown it is, when all are together,\n(The sons of the glorious gods,)\nWho bravest born shall seem;\nSome are valiant who redden no sword\nIn the blood of a foeman's breast.\"\n\n<i>Regin spake:</i>\n25. \"Glad art thou, Sigurth, of battle gained,\nAs Gram with grass thou cleansest;\nMy brother fierce in fight hast slain,\nAnd somewhat I did myself.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n26. \"Afar didst thou go while Fafnir reddened\nWith his blood my blade so keen;\nWith the might of the dragon my strength I matched,\nWhile thou in the heather didst hide.\"\n\n<i>Regin spake:</i>\n27. \"Longer wouldst thou in the heather have let\nYon hoary giant hide,\nHad the weapon availed not that once I forged,\nThe keen-edged blade thou didst bear.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n28. \"Better is heart than a mighty blade\nFor him who shall fiercely fight;\nThe brave man well shall fight and win,\nThough dull his blade may be.\n\n29. \"Brave men better than cowards be,\nWhen the clash of battle comes;\nAnd better the glad than the gloomy man\nShall face what before him lies.\n\n30. \"Thy rede it was that I should ride\nHither o'er mountains high;\nThe glittering worm would have wealth and life\nIf thou hadst not mocked at my might.\"\n\nThen Regin went up to Fafnir and cut out his heart with his sword, that was named Rithil, and then he drank blood from the wounds. Regin said:\n\n31. \"Sit now, Sigurth, for sleep will I,\nHold Fafnir's heart to the fire;\nFor all his heart shall eaten be,\nSince deep of blood I have drunk.\"\n\nSigurth took Fafnir's heart and cooked it on a spit. When he thought that it was fully cooked, and the blood foamed out of the heart, then he tried it with his finger to see whether it was fully cooked. He burned his finger, and put it in his mouth. But when Fafnir's heart's-blood came on his tongue, he understood the speech of birds. He heard nut-hatches chattering in the thickets. A nut hatch said:\n\n32. \"There sits Sigurth, sprinkled with blood,\nAnd Fafnir's heart with fire he cooks;\nWise were the breaker of rings, I ween,\nTo eat the life-muscles all so bright.\"\n\n<i>A second spake:</i>\n33. \"There Regin lies, and plans he lays\nThe youth to betray who trusts him well;\nLying words with wiles will he speak,\nTill his brother the maker of mischief avenges.\"\n\n<i>A third spake:</i>\n34. \"Less by a head let the chatterer hoary\nGo from here to hell;\nThen all of the wealth he alone can wield,\nThe gold that Fafnir guarded.\"\n\n<i>A fourth spake:</i>\n35. \"Wise would he seem if so he would heed\nThe counsel good we sisters give;\nThought he would give, and the ravens gladden,\nThere is ever a wolf where his ears I spy.\"\n\n<i>A fifth spake:</i>\n36. \"Less wise must be the tree of battle\nThan to me would seem the leader of men,\nIf forth he lets one brother fare,\nWhen he of the other the slayer is.\"\n\n<i>A sixth spake:</i>\n37. \"Most foolish he seems if he shall spare\nHis foe, the bane of the folk,\nThere Regin lies, who hath wronged him so,\nYet falsehood knows he not.\"\n\n<i>A seventh spake:</i>\n38. \"Let the head from the frost-cold giant be hewed,\nAnd let him of rings be robbed;\nThen all the wealth which Fafnir's was\nShall belong to thee alone.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n39. \"Not so rich a fate shall Regin have\nAs the tale of my death to tell;\nFor soon the brothers both shall die,\nAnd hence to hell shall go.\"\n\nSigurth hewed off Regin's head, and then he ate Fafnir's heart, and drank the blood of both Regin and Fafnir. Then Sigurth heard what the nut-hatch said:\n\n40. \"Bind, Sigurth, the golden rings together,\nNot kingly is it aught to fear;\nI know a maid, there is none so fair,\nRich in gold, if thou mightest get her.\n\n41. \"Green the paths that to Gjuki lead,\nAnd his fate the way to the wanderer shows;\nThe doughty king a daughter has,\nThat thou as a bride mayst, Sigurth, buy.\"\n\n<i>Another spake:</i>\n42. \"A hall stands high on Hindarfjoll,\nAll with flame is it ringed without;\nWarriors wise did make it once\nOut of the flaming light of the flood.\n\n43. \"On the mountain sleeps a battle-maid,\nAnd about her plays the bane of the wood;\nYgg with the thorn hath smitten her thus,\nFor she felled the fighter he fain would save.\n\n44. \"There mayst thou behold the maiden helmed,\nWho forth on Vingskornir rode from the fight;\nThe victory-bringer her sleep shall break not,\nThou heroes' son, so the Norns have set.\"\n\nSigurth rode along Fafnir's trail to his lair, and found it open. The gate-posts were of iron, and the gates; of iron, too, were all the beams in the house, which was dug down into the earth. There Sigurth found a mighty store of gold, and he filled two chests full thereof; he took the fear-helm and a golden mail-coat and the sword Hrotti, and many other precious things, and loaded Grani with them, but the horse would not go forward until Sigurth mounted on his back."
