	text = "~<Fragment of a Sigurth Lay~>\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n1. \"(What evil deed has Sigurth) done,\nThat the hero's life thou fain wouldst have?\"\n\n<i>Gunnar spake:</i>\n2. \"Sigurth oaths to me hath sworn,\nOaths hath sworn, and all hath broken;\nHe betrayed me there where truest all\nHis oaths, methinks, he ought to have kept.\"\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n3. \"Thy heart hath Brynhild whetted to hate,\nEvil to work and harm to win,\nShe grudges the honor that Guthrun has,\nAnd that joy of herself thou still dost have.\"\n\n4. They cooked a wolf, they cut up a snake,\nThey gave to Gotthorm the greedy one's flesh,\nBefore the men, to murder minded,\nLaid their hands on the hero bold.\n\n5. Slain was Sigurth south of the Rhine;\nFrom a limb a raven called full loud:\n\"Your blood shall redden Atli's blade,\nAnd your oaths shall bind you both in chains.\"\n\n6. Without stood Guthrun, Gjuki's daughter,\nHear now the speech that first she spake:\n\"Where is Sigurth now, the noble king,\nThat my kinsmen riding before him come?\"\n\n7. Only this did Hogni answer:\n\"Sigurth we with our swords have slain;\nThe gray horse mourns by his master dead.\"\n\n8. Then Brynhild spake, the daughter of Buthli:\n\"Well shall ye joy in weapons and lands;\nSigurth alone of all had been lord,\nIf a little longer his life had been.\n\n9. \"Right were it not that so he should rule\nO'er Gjuki's wealth and the race of the Goths;\nFive are the sons for ruling the folk,\nAnd greedy of fight, that he hath fathered.\"\n\n10. Then Brynhild laughed-- and the building echoed--\nOnly once, with all her heart;\n\"Long shall ye joy in lands and men,\nNow ye have slain the hero noble.\"\n\n11. Then Guthrun spake, the daughter of Gjuki:\n\"Much thou speakest in evil speech;\nAccursed be Gunnar, Sigurth's killer,\nVengeance shall come for his cruel heart.\"\n\n12. Early came evening, and ale was drunk,\nAnd among them long and loud they talked.;\nThey slumbered all when their beds they sought,\nBut Gunnar alone was long awake.\n\n13. His feet were tossing, he talked to himself,\nAnd the slayer of hosts began to heed\nWhat the twain from the tree had told him then,\nThe raven and eagle, as home they rode.\n\n14. Brynhild awoke, the daughter of Buthli,\nThe warrior's daughter, ere dawn of day:\n\"Love me or hate me, the harm is done,\nAnd my grief cries out, or else I die.\"\n\n15. Silent were all who heard her speak,\nAnd nought of the heart of the queen they knew,\nWho wept such tears the thing to tell\nThat laughing once of the men she had won.\n\n<i>Brynhild spake:</i>\n16. \"Gunnar, I dreamed a dream full grim:\nIn the hall were corpses; cold was my bed;\nAnd, ruler, thou didst joyless ride,\nWith fetters bound in the foemen's throng.\n\n17. \". . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nUtterly now your Niflung race\nAll shall die; your oaths ye have broken.\n\n18. \"Thou hast, Gunnar, the deed forgot,\nWhen blood in your footprints both ye mingled;\nAll to him hast repaid with ill\nWho fain had made thee the foremost of kings.\n\n19. \"Well did he prove, when proud he rode\nTo win me then thy wife to be,\nHow true the host-slayer ever had held\nThe oaths he had made with the monarch young.\n\n20. \"The wound-staff then, all wound with gold,\nThe hero let between us lie;\nWith fire the edge was forged full keen,\nAnd with drops of venom the blade was damp.\"\n\nHere it is told in this poem about the death of Sigurth, and the story goes here that they slew him out of doors, but some say that they slew him in the house, on his bed while he was sleeping. But German men say that they killed him out of doors in the forest; and so it is told in the old Guthrun lay, that Sigurth and Gjuki's sons had ridden to the council-place, and that he was slain there. But in this they are all agreed, that they deceived him in his trust of them, and fell upon him when he was lying down and unprepared."
