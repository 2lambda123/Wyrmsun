	text = "~<The Lament of Oddrun~>\n\nHeithrek was the name of a king, whose daughter was called Borgny. Vilmund was the name of the man who was her lover. She could not give birth to a child until Oddrun, Atli's sister, had come to her; Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar, son of Gjuki. About this story is the following poem.\n\n1. I have heard it told in olden tales\nHow a maiden came to Morningland;\nNo one of all on earth above\nTo Heithrek's daughter help could give.\n\n2. This Oddrun learned, the sister of Atli,\nThat sore the maiden's sickness was;\nThe bit-bearer forth from his stall she brought,\nAnd the saddle laid on the steed so black.\n\n3. She let the horse go o'er the level ground,\nTill she reached the hall that loftily rose,\n(And in she went from the end of the hall;)\nFrom the weary steed the saddle she took;\nHear now the speech that first she spake:\n\n4. \"What news on earth,  . . . . .\nOr what has happened in Hunland now?\"\n\n<i>A serving-maid spake:</i>\n\"Here Borgny lies in bitter pain,\nThy friend, and, Oddrun, thy help would find.\"\n\n<i>Oddrun spake:</i>\n5. 'Who worked this woe for the woman thus,\nOr why so sudden is Borgny sick?\"\n\n<i>The serving-maid spake:</i>\n\"Vilmund is he, the heroes' friend,\nWho wrapped the woman in bedclothes warm,\n(For winters five, yet her father knew not).\"\n\n6. Then no more they spake, methinks;\nShe went at the knees of the woman to sit;\nWith magic Oddrun and mightily Oddrun\nChanted for Borgny potent charms.\n\n7. At last were born a boy and girl,\nSon and daughter of Hogni's slayer;\nThen speech the woman so weak began,\nNor said she aught ere this she spake:\n\n8. \"So may the holy ones thee help,\nFrigg and Freyja and favoring gods,\nAs thou hast saved me from sorrow now.\"\n\n<i>Oddrun spake:</i>\n9. \"I came not hither to help thee thus\nBecause thou ever my aid didst earn;\nI fulfilled the oath that of old I swore,\nThat aid to all I should ever bring,\n(When they shared the wealth the warriors had).\"\n\n<i>Borgny spake:</i>\n10. \"Wild art thou, Oddrun, and witless now,\nThat so in hatred to me thou speakest;\nI followed thee where thou didst fare,\nAs we had been born of brothers twain.\"\n\n<i>Oddrun spake:</i>\n11. \"I remember the evil one eve thou spakest,\nWhen a draught I gave to Gunnar then;\nThou didst say that never such a deed\nBy maid was done save by me alone.\"\n\n12. Then the sorrowing woman sat her down\nTo tell the grief of her troubles great.\n\n13. \"Happy I grew in the hero's hall\nAs the warriors wished, and they loved me well;\nGlad I was of my father's gifts,\nFor winters five, while my father lived.\n\n14. \"These were the words the weary king,\nEre he died, spake last of all:\nHe bade me with red gold dowered to be,\nAnd to Grimhild's son in the South be wedded.\n\n15. \"But Brynhild the helm he bade to wear,\nA wish-maid bright he said she should be;\nFor a nobler maid would never be born\nOn earth, he said, if death should spare her.\n\n16. \"At her weaving Brynhild sat in her bower,\nLands and folk alike she had;\nThe earth and heaven high resounded\nWhen Fafnir's slayer the city saw.\n\n17. \"Then battle was fought with the foreign swords,\nAnd the city was broken that Brynhild had;\nNot long thereafter, but all too soon,\nTheir evil wiles full well she knew.\n\n18. \"Woeful for this her vengeance was,\nAs so we learned to our sorrow all;\nIn every land shall all men hear\nHow herself at Sigurth's side she slew.\n\n19. \"Love to Gunnar then I gave,\nTo the breaker of rings, as Brynhild might;\nTo Atli rings so red they offered,\nAnd mighty gifts to my brother would give.\n\n20. \"Fifteen dwellings fain would he give\nFor me, and the burden that Grani bore;\nBut Atli said he would never receive\nMarriage gold from Gjuki's son.\n\n21. \"Yet could we not our love o'ercome,\nAnd my head I laid on the hero's shoulder;\nMany there were of kinsmen mine\nWho said that together us they had seen.\n\n22. \"Atli said that never I\nWould evil plan, or ill deed do;\nBut none may this of another think,\nOr surely speak, when love is shared.\n\n23. \"Soon his men did Atli send,\nIn the murky wood on me to spy;\nThither they came where they should not come,\nWhere beneath one cover close we lay.\n\n24. \"To the warriors ruddy rings we offered,\nThat nought to Atli e'er they should say;\nBut swiftly home they hastened thence,\nAnd eager all to Atli told.\n\n25. \"But close from Guthrun kept they hid\nWhat first of all she ought to have known.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n26. \"Great was the clatter of gilded hoofs\nWhen Gjuki's sons through the gateway rode;\nThe heart they hewed from Hogni then,\nAnd the other they cast in the serpents' cave.\n\n27. \"The hero wise on his harp then smote,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nFor help from me in his heart yet hoped\nThe high-born king, might come to him.\n\n28. \"Alone was I gone to Geirmund then,\nThe draught to mix and ready to make;\nSudden I heard from Hlesey clear\nHow in sorrow the strings of the harp resounded.\n\n29. \"I bade the serving-maids ready to be,\nFor I longed the hero's life to save;\nAcross the sound the boats we sailed,\nTill we saw the whole of Atli's home.\n\n30. \"Then crawling the evil woman came,\nAtli's mother-- may she ever rot!\nAnd hard she bit to Gunnar's heart,\nSo I could not help the hero brave.\n\n31. \"Oft have I wondered how after this,\nSerpents'-bed goddess! I still might live,\nFor well I loved the warrior brave,\nThe giver of swords, as my very self.\n\n32. \"Thou didst see and listen, the while I said\nThe mighty grief that was mine and theirs;\nEach man lives as his longing wills,--\nOddrun's lament is ended now.\""
