	text = "~<The Second Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane~>\n\nKing Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi's foster-father. Hunding was the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior, and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these two, King Hunding and King Sigmund, and each slew the other's kinsmen. King Sigmund and his family were called Volsungs and Ylfings. Helgi went as a spy to the home of King Hunding in disguise. Hæming, a son of King Hunding's, was at home. When Helgi went forth, then he met a young herdsman, and said:\n\n1. \"Say to Hæming that Helgi knows\nWhom the heroes in armor hid;\nA gray wolf had they within their hall,\nWhom King Hunding Hamal thought.\"\n\nHamal was the name of Hagal's son. King Hunding sent men to Hagal to seek Helgi, and Helgi could not save himself in any other way, so he put on the clothes of a bond-woman and set to work at the mill. They sought Helgi but found him not.\n\n2. Then Blind spake out, the evil-minded:\n\" Of Hagal's bond-woman bright are the eyes;\nYon comes not of churls who stands at the quern;\nThe millstones break, the boards are shattered.\n\n3. \"The hero has a doom full hard,\nThat barley now he needs must grind;\nBetter befits his hand to feel\nThe hilt of the sword than the millstone's handle.\"\n\nHagal answered and said:\n\n4. \"Small is the wonder if boards are splintered\nBy a monarch's daughter the mill is turned;\nOnce through clouds she was wont to ride,\nAnd battles fought like fighting men,\n(Till Helgi a captive held her fast;\nSister she is of Sigar and Hogni,\nThus bright are the eyes of the Ylfings' maid.)\"\n\nHelgi escaped and went to a fighting ship. He slew King Hunding, and thenceforth was called Helgi Hundingsbane.\n\n~<(II)~>\n\nHe lay with his host in Brunavagar, and they had there a strand-slaughtering, and ate the flesh raw. Hogni\nwas the name of a king. His daughter was Sigrun; she was a Valkyrie and rode air and water; she was\nSvava reborn. Sigrun rode to Helgi's ship and said:\n\n5. \"Who rules the ship by the shore so steep?\nWhere is the home ye warriors have?\nWhy do ye bide in Brunavagar,\nOr what the way that ye wish to try?\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n6 \"Hamal's the ship by the shore so steep,\nOur home in Hlesey do we have;\nFor fair wind bide we in Brunavagar,\nEastward the way that we wish to try.\"\n\n<i>Sigrun spake:</i>\n7. \"Where hast thou, warrior, battle wakened,\nOr gorged the birds of the sisters of Guth?\nWhy is thy byrnie spattered with blood,\nWhy helmed dost feast on food uncooked?\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n8. \"Latest of all, the Ylfings' son\nOn the western sea, if know thou wilt,\nCaptured bears in Bragalund,\nAnd fed the eagles with edge of sword.\nNow is it shown why our shirts are bloody,\nAnd little our food with fire is cooked.\"\n\n<i>Sigrun spake:</i>\n9. \"Of battle thou tellest, and there was bent\nHunding the king before Helgi down;\nThere was carnage when thou didst avenge thy kin,\nAnd blood flowed fast on the blade of the sword.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n10. \"How didst thou know that now our kin,\nMaiden wise, we have well avenged?\nMany there are of the sons of the mighty\nWho share alike our lofty race.\"\n\n<i>Sigrun spake:</i>\n11. \"Not far was I from the lord of the folk,\nYester morn, when the monarch was slain;\nThough crafty the son of Sigmund, methinks,\nWhen he speaks of the fight in slaughter-runes.\n\n12. \"On the long-ship once I saw thee well,\nWhen in the blood-stained bow thou wast,\n(And round thee icy waves were raging;)\nNow would the hero hide from me,\nBut to Hogni's daughter is Helgi known.\"\n\n~<(III)~>\n\nGranmar was the name of a mighty king, who dwelt at Svarin's hill. He had many sons; one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings' meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni's daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding's sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:\n\n13. Sigrun the joyful chieftain sought,\nForthwith Helgi's hand she took;\nShe greeted the hero helmed and kissed him,\nThe warrior's heart to the woman turned.\n\n14. From her heart the daughter of Hogni spake,\nDear was Helgi, she said, to her;\n\"Long with all my heart I loved\nSigmund's son ere ever I saw him.\n\n15. \"At the meeting to Hothbrodd mated I was,\nBut another hero I fain would have;\nThough, king, the wrath of my kin I fear,\nSince I broke my father's fairest wish.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n16. \"Fear not ever Hogni's anger,\nNor yet thy kinsmen's cruel wrath;\nMaiden, thou with me shalt live,\nThy kindred, fair one, I shall not fear.\"\n\n~<(IV)~>\n\nHelgi then assembled a great sea-host and went to Frekastein. On the sea he met a perilous storm; lightning flashed overhead and the bolts struck the ship. They saw in the air that nine Valkyries were riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land. Granmar's sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:\n\n\"Who is the king who captains the fleet,\nAnd to the land the warriors leads?\"\n\nSinfjotli, Sigmund's son, answered him, and that too is written. Gothmund rode home with his tidings of the host; then Granmar's sons summoned an army. Many kings came there; there were Hogni, Sigrun's father, and his sons Bragi and Dag. There was a great battle, and all Granmar's sons were slain and all their allies; only Dag, Hogni's son, was spared, and he swore loyalty to the Volsungs. Sigrun went among the dead and found Hothbrodd at the coming of death. She said:\n\n17. \"Never shall Sigrun from Sevafjoll,\nHothbrodd king, be held in thine arms;\nGranmar's sons full cold have grown,\nAnd the giant-steeds gray on corpses gorge.\"\n\nThen she sought out Helgi, and was full of joy He said:\n\n18. \"Maid, not fair is all thy fortune,\nThe Norris I blame that this should be;\nThis morn there fell at Frekastein\nBragi and Hogni beneath my hand.\n\n19. \"At Hlebjorg fell the sons of Hrollaug,\nStarkath the king at Styrkleifar;\nFighters more noble saw I never,\nThe body fought when the head had fallen.\n\n20. \"On the ground full low the slain are lying,\nMost are there of the men of thy race;\nNought hast thou won, for thy fate it was\nBrave men to bring to the battle-field.\"\n\nThen Sigrun wept. Helgi said:\n\n21. \"Grieve not, Sigrun, the battle is gained,\nThe fighter can shun not his fate.\"\n<i>Sigrun spake:</i>\n\"To life would I call them who slaughtered lie,\nIf safe on thy breast I might be.\"\n\n~<(V)~>\n\nThis Gothmund the son of Granmar spoke:\n\n22. \"What hero great is guiding the ships?\nA golden flag on the stem he flies;\nI find not peace in the van of your faring,\nAnd round the fighters is battle-light red.\"\n\n<i>Sinfjotli spake:</i>\n23. \"Here may Hothbrodd Helgi find,\nThe hater of flight, in the midst of the fleet;\nThe home of all thy race he has,\nAnd over the realm of the fishes he rules.\"\n\n<i>Gothmund spake:</i>\n24. \"First shall swords at Frekastein\nProve our worth in place of words;\nTime is it, Hothbrodd, vengeance to have,\nIf in battle worsted once we were.\"\n\n<i>Sinfjotli spake:</i>\n25. \"Better, Gothmund, to tend the goats,\nAnd climb the rocks of the mountain cliffs;\nA hazel switch to hold in thy hand\nMore seemly were than the hilt of a sword.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n26. \"Better, Sinfjotli, thee 'twould beseem\nBattles to give, and eagles to gladden,\nThan vain and empty speech to utter,\nThough warriors oft with words do strive.\n\n27. \"Good I find not the sons of Granmar,\nBut for heroes 'tis seemly the truth to speak;\nAt Moinsheimar proved the men\nThat hearts for the wielding of swords they had,\n(And ever brave the warriors are.)\"\n\n~<(VI)~>\n\nHelgi took Sigrun to wife, and they had sons. Helgi did not reach old age. Dag, the son of Hogni, offered sacrifice to Othin to be avenged for his father's death; Othin gave Dag his spear. Dag found Helgi, his brother-in-law, at a place which is called Fjoturlund. He thrust the spear through Helgi's body. Then Helgi fell, and Dag rode to Sevafjoll and told Sigrun the tidings:\n\n28. \"Sad am I, sister, sorrow to tell thee,\nWoe to my kin unwilling I worked;\nIn the morn there fell at Fjoturlund\nThe noblest prince the world has known,\n(And his heel he set on the heroes' necks.)\"\n\n<i>Sigrun spake:</i>\n29. \"Now may every oath thee bite\nThat with Helgi sworn thou hast,\nBy the water bright of Leipt,\nAnd the ice-cold stone of Uth.\n\n30. \"The ship shall sail not in which thou sailest,\nThough a favoring wind shall follow after;\nThe horse shall run not whereon thou ridest,\nThough fain thou art thy foe to flee.\n\n31. . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\"The sword shall bite not which thou bearest,\nTill thy head itself it sings about.\n\n32. \"Vengeance were mine for Helgi's murder,\nWert thou a wolf in the woods without,\nPossessing nought and knowing no joy,\nHaving no food save corpses to feed on.\"\n\n<i>Dag spake:</i>\n33. \"Mad art thou, sister, and wild of mind,\nSuch a curse on thy brother to cast;\nOthin is ruler of every ill,\nWho sunders kin with runes of spite.\n\n34. \"Thy brother rings so red will give thee,\nAll Vandilsve and Vigdalir;\nTake half my land to pay the harm,\nRing-decked maid, and as meed for thy sons.\"\n\n<i>Sigrun spake:</i>\n35. \"I shall sit not happy at Sevafjoll,\nEarly or late, my life to love,\nIf the light cannot show, in the leader's band,\nVigblær bearing him back to his home,\n(The golden-bitted; I shall greet him never.)\n\n36. \"Such the fear that Helgi's foes\nEver felt, and all their kin,\nAs makes the goats with terror mad\nRun from the wolf among the rocks.\n\n37. \"Helgi rose above heroes all\nLike the lofty ash above lowly thorns,\nOr the noble stag, with dew besprinkled,\nBearing his head above all beasts,\n(And his horns gleam bright to heaven itself.)\n\nA hill was made in Helgi's memory. And when he came to Valhall, then Othin bade him rule over every thing with himself.\n\n~<(VII)~>\n\n<i>Helgi said:</i>\nA \"Thou shalt, Hunding, of every hero\nWash the feet, and kindle the fire,\nTie up dogs, and tend the horses,\nAnd feed the swine ere to sleep thou goest.\"\n\n~<(VIII)~>\n\nOne of Sigrun's maidens went one evening to Helgi's hill, and saw that Helgi rode to the hill with many men, The maiden said:\n\n39. \"Is this a dream that methinks I see,\nOr the doom of the gods, that dead men ride,\nAnd hither spurring urge your steeds,\nOr is home-coming now to the heroes granted?\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n40. \"No dream is this that thou thinkest to see,\nNor the end of the world, though us thou beholdest,\nAnd hither spurring we urge our steeds,\nNor is home-coming now to the heroes granted.\"\n\nThe maiden went home and said to Sigrun:\n\n41. \"Go forth, Sigrun, from Sevafjoll,\nIf fain the lord of the folk wouldst find;\n(The hill is open, Helgi is come;)\nThe sword-tracks bleed; the monarch bade\nThat thou his wounds shouldst now make well.\"\n\nSigrun went in the hill to Helgi, and said:\n\n42. \"Now am I glad of our meeting together,\nAs Othin's hawks, so eager for prey,\nWhen slaughter and flesh all warm they scent,\nOr dew-wet see the red of day.\n\n43. \"First will I kiss the lifeless king,\nEre off the bloody byrnie thou cast;\nWith frost thy hair is heavy, Helgi,\nAnd damp thou art with the dew of death;\n(Ice-cold hands has Hogni's kinsman,\nWhat, prince, can I to bring thee ease?)\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n44. \"Thou alone, Sigrun of Sevafjoll,\nArt cause that Helgi with dew is heavy;\nGold-decked maid, thy tears are grievous,\n(Sun-bright south-maid, ere thou sleepest;)\nEach falls like blood on the hero's breast,\n(Burned-out, cold, and crushed with care.)\n\n45. \"Well shall we drink a noble draught,\nThough love and lands are lost to me;\nNo man a song of sorrow shall sing,\nThough bleeding wounds are on my breast;\nNow in the hill our brides we hold,\nThe heroes' loves, by their husbands dead.\"\n\nSigrun made ready a bed in the hill.\n\n46. \"Here a bed I have made for thee, Helgi,\nTo rest thee from care, thou kin of the Ylfings;\nI will make thee sink to sleep in my arms,\nAs once I lay with the living king.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n47. \"Now do I say that in Sevafjoll\nAught may happen, early or late,\nSince thou sleepest clasped in a corpse's arms,\nSo fair in the hill, the daughter of Hogni!\n(Living thou comest, a daughter of kings.)\n\n48. \"Now must I ride the reddened ways,\nAnd my bay steed set to tread the sky;\nWestward I go to wind-helm's bridges,\nEre Salgofnir wakes the warrior throng.\"\n\nThen Helgi and his followers rode on their way, and the women went home to the dwelling. Another evening Sigrun bade the maiden keep watch at the hill. And at sunset when Sigrun came to the hill she said:\n\n49. \"Now were he come, if come he might,\nSigmund's son, from Othin's seat;\nHope grows dim of the hero's return\nWhen eagles sit on the ash-tree boughs,\nAnd men are seeking the meeting of dreams.\"\n\n<i>The Maiden said:</i>\n50. \"Mad thou wouldst seem alone to seek,\nDaughter of heroes, the house of the dead;\nFor mightier now at night are all\nThe ghosts of the dead than when day is bright.\"\n\nSigrun was early dead of sorrow and grief. It was believed in olden times that people were born again, but that is now called old wives' folly. Of Helgi and Sigrun it is said that they were born again; he became Helgi Haddingjaskati, and she Kara the daughter of Halfdan, as is told in the Lay of Kara, and she was a Valkyrie."
