	text = "~<The Lay of Helgi the Son of Hjorvarth~>\n\n~<(I)~>\n\n~<Of Hjorvarth and Sigrlin~>\n\nHjorvarth was the name of a king, who had four wives: one was called Alfhild, and their son was named Hethin; the second was called Særeith, and their son was named Humlung; the third was called Sinrjoth, and their son was named Hymling. King Hjorvarth had made a great vow to have as wife whatsoever woman he knew was fairest. He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others, whose name was Sigrlin. Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls; he had a son called Atli, who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king. He dwelt the winter long with King Svafnir. There was a jarl called Franmar, Sigrlin's foster-father; his daughter was named Alof. The jarl told him that the maiden's hand was denied, and Atli went home. Atli, the jarl's son, stood one day in a certain wood; a bird sat in the branches up over him, and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarth's wives the fairest of women. The bird twittered, and Atli hearkened to what it spoke. It said:\n\n1. \"Sawest thou Sigrlin, Svafnir's daughter,\nThe fairest maid in her home-land found?\nThough Hjorvath's wives by men are held\nGoodly to see in Glasir's wood.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n2. \"Now with Atli, Ithmund's son,\nWilt thou say more, thou bird so wise?\"\n\n<i>The bird spake:</i>\n\"I may if the prince an offering makes,\nAnd I have what I will from the house of the king.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n3. \"Choose not Hjorvarth, nor sons of his,\nNor the wives so fair of the famous chief;\nAsk not the brides that the prince's are;\nFair let us deal in friendly wise.\"\n\n<i>The bird spake:</i>\n4. \"A fane will I ask, and altars many,\nGold-horned cattle the prince shall give me,\nIf Sigrlin yet shall sleep in his arms,\nOr free of will the hero shall follow.\"\n\nThis was before Atli went on his journey; but when he came home, and the king asked his tidings, he said:\n\n5. \"Trouble we had, but tidings none,\nOur horses failed in the mountains high,\nThe waters of Sæmorn we needs must wade;\nSvafnir's daughter, with rings bedecked,\nShe whom we sought, was still denied us.\"\n\nThe king bade that they should go another time, and he went with them himself, But when they came up on the mountain, they saw Svavaland burning and mighty dust-clouds from many steeds. The king rode from the mountain forward into the land, and made a night's stay hard by a stream. Atli kept watch and went over the stream; he found there a house. A great bird sat on the housetop to guard it, but he was asleep. Atli hurled his spear at the bird and slew it, and in the house he found Sigrlin the king's daughter and Alof the jarl's daughter, and he brought them both thence with him. Jarl Franmar had changed himself into the likeness of an eagle, and guarded them from the enemy host by magic. Hrothmar was the name of a king, a wooer of Sigrlin; he slew the king of Svavaland and had plundered and burned his land. King Hjorvarth took Sigrlin, and Atli took Alof.\n\n~<(II)~>\n\nHjorvarth and Sigrlin had a son, mighty and of noble stature; he was a silent man, and no name stuck fast to him. He sat on a hill, and saw nine Valkyries riding; one of them was the fairest of all. She spake:\n\n6. \"Late wilt thou, Helgi, have hoard of rings,\nThou battle-tree fierce, or of shining fields,--\nThe eagle screams soon,-- if never thou speakest,\nThough, hero, hard thy heart may cry.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n7. \"What gift shall I have with Helgi's name,\nGlorious maid, for the giving is thine?\nAll thy words shall I think on well,\nBut I want them not if I win not thee.\"\n\n<i>The Valkyrie spake:</i>\n8. \"Swords I know lying in Sigarsholm,\nFifty there are save only four;\nOne there is that is best of all,\nThe shield-destroyer, with gold it shines.\n\n9. \"In the hilt is fame, in the haft is courage,\nIn the point is fear, for its owner's foes;\nOn the blade there lies a blood-flecked snake,\nAnd a serpent's tail round the flat is twisted.\"\n\nEylimi was the name of a king, whose daughter was Svava; she was a Valkyrie, and rode air and sea. She gave Helgi this name, and shielded him oft thereafter in battle. Helgi spake:\n\n10. \"Hjorvarth, king, unwholesome thy counsels,\nThough famed thou art in leading the folk,\nLetting fire the homes of heroes eat,\nWho evil deed had never done thee.\n\n11. \"Yet Hrothmar still the hoard doth hold,\nThe wealth that once our kinsmen wielded;\nFull seldom care the king disturbs,\nHeir to dead men he deems himself.\"\n\nHjorvarth answered that he would give Helgi a following if he fain would avenge his mother's father. Then Helgi got the sword that Svava had told him of. So he went, and Atli with him, and they slew Hrothmar, and they did many great deeds.\n\n~<(III)~>\n\nHe slew the giant Hati, whom he found sitting on a certain mountain. Helgi and Atli lay with their ships in Hatafjord. Atli kept watch during the first part of the night. Hrimgerth, Hati's daughter, spake:\n\n12. \"Who are the heroes in Hatafjord?\nThe ships are covered with shields;\nBravely ye look, and little ye fear,\nThe name of the king would I know.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n13. \"Helgi his name, and never thou mayst\nHarm to the hero bring;\nWith iron is fitted the prince's fleet,\nNor can witches work us ill.\"\n\n<i>Hrimgerth spake:</i>\n14. \"Who now, thou mighty man, art thou?\nBy what name art thou known to men?\nHe trusts thee well, the prince who wills\nThat thou stand at the stem of his ship.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n15. \"Atli am I, and ill shalt thou find me,\nGreat hate for witches I have;\nOft have I been in the dripping bows,\nAnd to dusk-riders death have brought.\n\n16. \"Corpse-hungry giantess, how art thou called?\nSay, witch, who thy father was!\nNine miles deeper down mayst thou sink,\nAnd a tree grow tall on thy bosom.\"\n\n<i>Hrimgerth spake:</i>\n17. \"Hrimgerth am I, my father was Hati,\nOf giants the most in might;\nMany a woman he won from her home,\nEre Helgi hewed him down.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n18. \"Witch, in front of the ship thou wast,\nAnd lay before the fjord;\nTo Ron wouldst have given the ruler's men,\nIf a spear had not stuck in thy flesh.\"\n\n<i>Hrimgerth spake:</i>\n19. \"Dull art thou, Atli, thou dreamest, methinks,\nThe lids lie over thine eyes;\nBy the leader's ships my mother lay,\nHlothvarth's sons on the sea I slew.\n\n20. \"Thou wouldst neigh, Atli, but gelded thou art,\nSee, Hrimgerth hoists her tail;\nIn thy hinder end is thy heart, methinks,\nThough thy speech is a stallion's cry.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n21. \"A stallion I seem if thou seekest to try me,\nAnd I leap to land from the sea;\nI shall smite thee to bits, if so I will,\nAnd heavy sinks Hrimgerth's tail.\"\n\n<i>Hrimgerth spake:</i>\n22. \"Go ashore then, Atli, if sure of thy might,\nLet us come to Varin's cove;\nStraight shall thy rounded ribs be made\nIf thou comest within my claws.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n23. \"I will not go till the warriors wake,\nAgain their chief to guard;\nI should wonder not, foul witch, if up\nFrom beneath our keel thou shouldst come.\"\n\n<i>Hrimgerth spake:</i>\n24. \"Awake now, Helgi, and Hrimgerth requite,\nThat Hati to death thou didst hew;\nIf a single night she can sleep by the prince,\nThen requited are all her ills.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n25. \" 'Tis Lothin shall have thee,-- thou'rt loathsome to men,--\nHis home in Tholley he has;\nOf the wild-dwellers worst is the giant wise,\nHe is meet as a mate for thee.\"\n\n<i>Hrimgerth spake:</i>\n26. \"More thou lovest her who scanned the harbor,\nLast night among the men;\n(The gold-decked maid bore magic, rnethinks,\nWhen the land from the sea she sought,\nAnd fast she kept your fleet;)\nShe alone is to blame that I may not bring\nDeath to the monarch's men.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n27. \"Hrimgerth, mark, if thy hurts I requite,\nTell now the truth to the king;\nWas there one who the ships of the warrior warded,\nOr did many together go?\"\n\n<i>Hrimgerth spake:</i>\n28. \"Thrice nine there were, but one rode first,\nA helmed maid white of hue;\nTheir horses quivered, there came from their manes\nDew in the dales so deep,\n(Hail on the woods so high,\nThence men their harvest have,\nBut ill was the sight I saw.)\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n29. \"Look eastward, Hrimgerth, for Helgi has struck thee\nDown with the runes of death;\nSafe in harbor floats the prince's fleet,\nAnd safe are the monarch's men.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n30. \"It is day, Hrimgerth, for Atli held thee\nTill now thy life thou must lose;\nAs a harbor mark men shall mock at thee,\nWhere in stone thou shalt ever stand.\"\n\n~<(IV)~>\n\nKing Helgi was a mighty warrior. He came to King Eylimi and sought the hand of his daughter, Svava. Then Helgi and Svava exchanged vows, and greatly they loved each other. Svava was at home with her father, while Helgi was in the field; Svava was still a Valkyrie as before.\n\nHethin was at home with his father, King Hjorvarth, in Norway. Hethin was coming home alone from the forest one Yule-eve, and found a troll-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hethin for his company. \"Nay,\" said he. She said, \"Thou shalt pay for this at the king's toast.\" That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the king's toast. Hethin vowed that he would have Svava, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother. Helgi said:\n\n31. \"Welcome, Hethin! what hast thou to tell\nOf tidings new that from Norway come?\nWherefore didst leave thy land, O prince,\nAnd fared alone to find us here?\"\n\n<i>Hethin spake:</i>\n32. \"A deed more evil I have done\nThan, brother mine, thou e'er canst mend;\nFor I have chosen the child of the king,\nThy bride, for mine at the monarch's toast.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n33. \"Grieve not, Hethin, for true shall hold\nThe words we both by the beer have sworn;\nTo the isle a warrior wills that I go,\n(There shall I come the third night hence;)\nAnd doubtful must be my coming back,\n(So may all be well, if fate so wills.)\"\n\n<i>Hethin spake:</i>\n34. \"Thou saidst once, Helgi, that Hethin was\nA friend full good, and gifts didst give him;\nMore seemly it were thy sword to redden,\nThan friendship thus to thy foe to-give.\"\n\nHelgi spoke thus because he foresaw his death, for his following-spirits had met Hethin when he saw the woman riding on the wolf. Alf was the name of a king, the son of Hrothmar, who had marked out a battle-place with Helgi at Sigarsvoll after a stay of three nights. Then Helgi spake:\n\n35. \"On a wolf there rode, when dusk it was,\nA woman who fain would have him follow;\nWell she knew that now would fall\nSigrlin's son at Sigarsvoll.\"\n\nThere was a great battle, and there Helgi got a mortal wound.\n\n36. Sigar riding did Helgi send\nTo seek out Eylimi's only daughter:\n\"Bid her swiftly ready to be,\nIf her lover alive she would find.\"\n\n<i>Sigar spake:</i>\n37. \"Hither now has Helgi sent me,\nWith thee, Svava, thyself to speak;\nThe hero said he fain would see thee\nEre life the nobly born should leave.\"\n\n<i>Svava spake:</i>\nA \"What chanced with Helgi, Hjorvarth's son?\nHard to me is harm now come;\nIf the sea smote him, or sword bit him,\nIll shall I bring to all his foes.\"\n\n<i>Sigar spake:</i>\n39. \"In the morn he fell at Frekastein,\nThe king who was noblest beneath the sun;\nAlf has the joy of victory all,\nThough need therefor is never his.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n40. \"Hail to thee, Svava! thy sorrow rule,\nOur meeting last in life is this;\nHard the wounds of the hero bleed,\nAnd close to my heart the sword has come.\n\n41. \"I bid thee, Svava,-- weep not, bride,--\nIf thou wilt hearken to these my words,\nThe bed for Hethin have thou ready,\nAnd yield thy love to the hero young.\"\n\n<i>Svava spake:</i>\n42. \"A vow I had in my dear-loved home,\nWhen Helgi sought with rings to have me,\nThat not of my will, if the warrior died,\nWould I fold in my arms a man unfamed.\"\n\n<i>Hethin spake:</i>\n43. \"Kiss me, Svava, I come not back,\nRogheim to see, or Rothulsfjoll,\nTill vengeance I have for the son of Hjorvarth,\nThe king who was noblest beneath the sun.\"\n\nOf Helgi and Svava it is said that they were born again."
