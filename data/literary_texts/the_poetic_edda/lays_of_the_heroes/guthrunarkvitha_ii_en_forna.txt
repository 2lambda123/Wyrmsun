	text = "~<The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun~>\n\nKing Thjothrek was with Atli, and had lost most of his men. Thjothrek and Guthrun lamented their griefs together. She spoke to him, saying:\n\n1. A maid of maids my mother bore me,\nBright in my bower, my brothers I loved,\nTill Gjuki dowered me with gold,\nDowered with gold, and to Sigurth gave me.\n\n2. So Sigurth rose o'er Gjuki's sons\nAs the leek grows green above the grass,\nOr the stag o'er all the beasts doth stand,\nOr as glow-red gold above silver gray.\n\n3. Till my brothers let me no longer have\nThe best of heroes my husband to be;\nSleep they could not, or quarrels settle,\nTill Sigurth they at last had slain.\n\n4. From the Thing ran Grani with thundering feet,\nBut thence did Sigurth himself come never;\nCovered with sweat was the saddle-bearer,\nWont the warrior's weight to bear.\n\n5. Weeping I sought with Grani to speak,\nWith tear-wet cheeks for the tale I asked;\nThe head of Grani was bowed to the grass,\nThe steed knew well his master was slain.\n\n6. Long I waited and pondered well\nEre ever the king for tidings I asked.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n7. His head bowed Gunnar, but Hogni told\nThe news full sore of Sigurth slain:\n\"Hewed to death at our hands he lies,\nGotthorm's slayer, given to wolves.\n\n8. \"On the southern road thou shalt Sigurth see,\nWhere hear thou canst the ravens cry;\nThe eagles cry as food they crave,\nAnd about thy husband wolves are howling.\"\n\n9. \"Why dost thou, Hogni, such a horror\nLet me hear, all joyless left?\nRavens yet thy heart shall rend\nIn a land that never thou hast known.\"\n\n10. Few the words of Hogni were,\nBitter his heart from heavy sorrow:\n\"Greater, Guthrun, thy grief shall be\nIf the ravens so my heart shall rend.\"\n\n11. From him who spake I turned me soon,\nIn the woods to find what the wolves had left;\nTears I had not, nor wrung my bands,\nNor wailing went, as other women,\n(When by Sigurth slain I sat).\n\n12. Never so black had seemed the night\nAs when in sorrow by Sigurth I sat;\nThe wolves . . . . .  . . . . .\n\n13. . . . . .  . . . . .\nBest of all methought 'twould be\nIf I my life could only lose,\nOr like to birch-wood burned might be.\n\n14. From the mountain forth five days I fared,\nTill Hoalf's hall so high I saw;\nSeven half-years with Thora I stayed,\nHokon's daughter, in Denmark then.\n\n15. With gold she broidered, to bring me joy,\nSouthern halls and Danish swans;\nOn the tapestry wove we warrior's deeds,\nAnd the hero's thanes on our handiwork;\n(Flashing shields and fighters armed,\nSword-throng, helm-throng, the host of the king).\n\n16. Sigmund's ship by the land was sailing,\nGolden the figure-head, gay the beaks;\nOn board we wove the warriors faring,\nSigar and Siggeir, south to Fjon.\n\n17. Then Grimhild asked, the Gothic queen,\nWhether willingly would I  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n18. Her needlework cast she aside, and called\nHer sons to ask, with stern resolve,\nWho amends to their sister would make for her son,\nOr the wife requite for her husband killed.\n\n19. Ready was Gunnar gold to give,\nAmends for my hurt, and Hogni too;\nThen would she know who now would go,\nThe horse to saddle, the wagon to harness,\n(The horse to ride, the hawk to fly,\nAnd shafts from bows of yew to shoot).\n\n20. (Valdar, king of the Danes, was come,\nWith Jarizleif, Eymoth, and Jarizskar).\nIn like princes came they all,\nThe long-beard men, with mantles red,\nShort their mail-coats, mighty their helms,\nSwords at their belts, and brown their hair.\n\n21. Each to give me gifts was fain,\nGifts to give, and goodly speech,\nComfort so for my sorrows great\nTo bring they tried, but I trusted them not.\n\n22. A draught did Grimhild give me to drink,\nBitter and cold; I forgot my cares;\nFor mingled therein was magic earth,\nIce-cold sea, and the blood of swine.\n\n23. In the cup were runes of every kind,\nWritten and reddened, I could not read them;\nA heather-fish from the Haddings' land,\nAn ear uncut, and the entrails of beasts.\n\n24. Much evil was brewed within the beer,\nBlossoms of trees, and acorns burned,\nDew of the hearth, and holy entrails,\nThe liver of swine,-- all grief to allay.\n\n25. Then I forgot, when the draught they gave me,\nThere in the hall, my husband's slaying;\nOn their knees the kings all three did kneel,\nEre she herself to speak began:\n\n26. \"Guthrun, gold to thee I give,\nThe wealth that once thy father's was,\nRings to have, and Hlothver's halls,\nAnd the hangings all that the monarch had.\n\n27. \"Hunnish women, skilled in weaving,\nWho gold make fair to give thee joy,\nAnd the wealth of Buthli thine shall be,\nGold-decked one, as Atli's wife.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n28. \"A husband now I will not have,\nNor wife of Brynhild's brother be;\nIt beseems me not with Buthli's son\nHappy to be, and heirs to bear.\"\n\n<i>Grimhild spake:</i>\n29. \"Seek not on men to avenge thy sorrows,\nThough the blame at first with us hath been;\nHappy shalt be as if both still lived,\nSigurth and Sigmund, if sons thou bearest.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n30. \"Grimhild, I may not gladness find,\nNor hold forth hopes to heroes now,\nSince once the raven and ravening wolf\nSigurth's heart's-blood hungrily lapped.\"\n\n<i>Grimhild spake:</i>\n31. \"Noblest of birth is the ruler now\nI have found for thee, and foremost of all;\nHim shalt thou have while life thou hast,\nOr husbandless be if him thou wilt choose not.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n32. \"Seek not so eagerly me to send\nTo be a bride of yon baneful race;\nOn Gunnar first his wrath shall fall,\nAnd the heart will he tear from Hogni's breast.\"\n\n33. Weeping Grimhild heard the words\nThat fate full sore for her sons foretold,\n(And mighty woe for them should work;)\n\"Lands I give thee, with all that live there,\n(Vinbjorg is thine, and Valbjorg too,)\nHave them forever, but hear me, daughter.\"\n\n34. So must I do as the kings besought,\nAnd against my will for my kinsmen wed,\nNe'er with my husband joy I had,\nAnd my sons by my brothers' fate were saved not.\n\n35. . . . . .  . . . . .\nI could not rest till of life I had robbed\nThe warrior bold, the maker of battles.\n\n36. Soon on horseback each hero was,\nAnd the foreign women in wagons faring;\nA week through lands so cold we went,\nAnd a second week the waves we smote,\n(And a third through lands that water lacked).\n\n37. The warders now on the lofty walls\nOpened the gates, and in we rode.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n38. Atli woke me, for ever I seemed\nOf bitterness full for my brothers' death.\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n39. \"Now from sleep the Norris have waked me\nWith visions of terror,-- to thee will I tell them;\nMethought thou, Guthrun, Gjuki's daughter,\nWith poisoned blade didst pierce my body.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n40. \"Fire a dream of steel shall follow\nAnd willful pride one of woman's wrath;\nA baneful sore I shall burn from thee,\nAnd tend and heal thee, though hated thou am\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n41. \"Of plants I dreamed, in the garden drooping,\nThat fain would I have full high to grow;\nPlucked by the roots, and red with blood,\nThey brought them hither, and bade me eat.\n\n42. \"I dreamed my hawks from my hand had flown,\nEager for food, to an evil house;\nI dreamed their hearts with honey I ate,\nSoaked in blood, and heavy my sorrow.\n\n43. \"Hounds I dreamed from my hand I loosed,\nLoud in hunger and pain they howled;\nTheir flesh methought was eagles' food,\nAnd their bodies now I needs must eat.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n44. \"Men shall soon of sacrifice speak,\nAnd off the heads of beasts shall hew\nDie they shall ere day has dawned,\nA few nights hence, and the folk shall have them.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n45. \"On my bed I sank, nor slumber sought,\nWeary with woe,-- full well I remember.\n. . . . .  . . . . ."
