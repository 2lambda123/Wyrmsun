	text = "~<The Lay of Völund~>\n\nThere was a king in Sweden named Nithuth. He had two sons and one daughter; her name was Bothvild. There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns: one was called Slagfith, another Egil, the third Völund. They went on snowshoes and hunted wild beasts. They came into Ulfdalir and there they built themselves a house; there was a lake there which is called Ulfsjar. Early one morning they found on the shore of the lake three women, who were spinning flax. Near them were their swan garments, for they were Valkyries. Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland. These did they bring home to their hall with them. Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and Völund All-Wise. There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles, and came back no more. Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith followed Swan White, but Völund stayed in Ulfdalir. He was a most skillful man, as men know from old tales. King Nithuth had him taken by force, as the poem here tells.\n\n1. Maids from the south through Myrkwood flew,\nFair and young, their fate to follow;\nOn the shore of the sea to rest them they sat,\nThe maids of the south, and flax they spun.\n\n2. . . . . . . . . . .\nHlathguth and Hervor, Hlothver's children,\nAnd Olrun the Wise Kjar's daughter was.\n\n3. . . . . . . . . . .\nOne in her arms took Egil then\nTo her bosom white, the woman fair.\n\n4. Swan-White second,-- swan-feathers she wore,\n. . . . . . . . . .\nAnd her arms the third of the sisters threw\nNext round Völund's neck so white.\n\n5. There did they sit for seven winters,\nIn the eighth at last came their longing again,\n(And in the ninth did need divide them).\nThe maidens yearned for the murky wood,\nThe fair young maids, their fate to follow.\n\n6. Völund home from his hunting came,\nFrom a weary way, the weather-wise bowman,\nSlagfith and Egil the hall found empty,\nOut and in went they, everywhere seeking.\n\n7. East fared Egil after Olrun,\nAnd Slagfith south to seek for Swan-White;\nVölund alone in Ulfdalir lay,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n8. Red gold he fashioned with fairest gems,\nAnd rings he strung on ropes of bast;\nSo for his wife he waited long,\nIf the fair one home might come to him.\n\n9. This Nithuth learned, the lord of the Njars,\nThat Völund alone in Ulfdalir lay;\nBy night went his men, their mail-coats were studded,\nTheir shields in the waning moonlight shone.\n\n10. From their saddles the gable wall they sought,\nAnd in they went at the end of the hall;\nRings they saw there on ropes of bast,\nSeven hundred the hero had.\n\n11. Off they took them, but all they left\nSave one alone which they bore away.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n12. Völund home from his hunting came,\nFrom a weary way, the weather-wise bowman;\nA brown bear's flesh would he roast with fire;\nSoon the wood so dry was burning well,\n(The wind-dried wood that Völund's was).\n\n13. On the bearskin he rested, and counted the rings,\nThe master of elves, but one he missed;\nThat Hlothver's daughter had it he thought,\nAnd the all-wise maid had come once more.\n\n14. So long he sat that he fell asleep,\nHis waking empty of gladness was;\nHeavy chains he saw on his hands,\nAnd fetters bound his feet together.\n\n<i>Völund spake:</i>\n15. \"What men are they who thus have laid\nRopes of bast to bind me now?\"\n\nThen Nithuth called, the lord of the Njars:\n\"How gottest thou, Völund, greatest of elves,\nThese treasures of ours in Ulfdalir?\"\n\n<i>Völund spake:</i>\n16. \"The gold was not on Grani's way,\nFar, methinks, is our realm from the hills of the Rhine;\nI mind me that treasures more we had\nWhen happy together at home we were.\"\n\n17. Without stood the wife of Nithuth wise,\nAnd in she came from the end of the hall;\nOn the floor she stood, and softly spoke:\n\"Not kind does he look who comes from the wood.\"\n\nKing Nithuth gave to his daughter Bothvild the gold ring that he had taken from the bast rope in Völund's house, and he himself wore the sword that Völund had had. The queen spake:\n\n18. \"The glow of his eyes is like gleaming snakes,\nHis teeth he gnashes if now is shown\nThe sword, or Bothvild's ring he sees;\nLet them straightway cut his sinews of strength,\nAnd set him then in Sævarstath.\"\n\nSo was it done: the sinews in his knee-joints were cut, and he was set in an island which was near the mainland, and was called Sævarstath. There he smithied for the king all kinds of precious things. No man dared to go to him, save only the king himself. Völund spake:\n\n19. \"At Nithuth's girdle gleams the sword\nThat I sharpened keen with cunningest craft,\n(And hardened the steel with highest skill;)\nThe bright blade far forever is borne,\n(Nor back shall I see it borne to my smithy;)\nNow Bothvild gets the golden ring\n(That was once my bride's,-- ne'er well shall it be.)\"\n\n20. He sat, nor slept, and smote with his hammer,\nFast for Nithuth wonders he fashioned;\nTwo boys did go in his door to gaze,\nNithuth's sons, into Sævarstath.\n\n21. They came to the chest, and they craved the keys,\nThe evil was open when in they looked;\nTo the boys it seemed that gems they saw,\nGold in plenty and precious stones.\n\n<i>Völund spake:</i>\n22. \"Come ye alone, the next day come,\nGold to you both shall then be given;\nTell not the maids or the men of the hall,\nTo no one say that me you have sought.\"\n\n23. . . . . . . . . . .\nEarly did brother to brother call:\n\"Swift let us go the rings to see.\"\n\n24. They came to the chest, and they craved the keys,\nThe evil was open when in they looked;\nHe smote off their heads, and their feet he hid\nUnder the sooty straps of the bellows.\n\n25. Their skulls, once hid by their hair, he took,\nSet them in silver and sent them to Nithuth;\nGems full fair from their eyes he fashioned,\nTo Nithuth's wife so wise he gave them.\n\n26. And from the teeth of the twain he wrought\nA brooch for the breast, to Bothvild he sent it;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n27. Bothvild then of her ring did boast,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . \"The ring I have broken,\nI dare not say it save to thee.\"\n\n<i>Völund spake:</i>\n28. 'I shall weld the break in the gold so well\nThat fairer than ever thy father shall find it,\nAnd better much thy mother shall think it,\nAnd thou no worse than ever it was.\"\n\n29. Beer he brought, he was better in cunning,\nUntil in her seat full soon she slept.\n\n<i>Völund spake:</i>\n\"Now vengeance I have for all my hurts,\nSave one alone, on the evil woman.\"\n\n30. . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\nQuoth Völund: \"Would that well were the sinews\nMaimed in my feet by Nithuth's men.\"\n\n31. Laughing Völund rose aloft,\nWeeping Bothvild went from the isle,\nFor her lover's flight and her father's wrath.\n\n32. Without stood the wife of Nithuth wise,\nAnd in she came from the end of the hall;\nBut he by the wall in weariness sat:\n\"Wakest thou, Nithuth, lord of the Njars?\"\n\n<i>Nithuth spake:</i>\n33. \"Always I wake, and ever joyless,\nLittle I sleep since my sons were slain;\nCold is my head, cold was thy counsel,\nOne thing, with Völund to speak, I wish.\n\n34. . . . . . . . . . .\n\"Answer me, Völund, greatest of elves,\nWhat happed with my boys that hale once were?\"\n\n<i>Völund spake:</i>\n35. \"First shalt thou all the oaths now swear,\nBy the rail of ship, and the rim of shield,\nBy the shoulder of steed, and the edge of sword,\nThat to Völund's wife thou wilt work no ill,\nNor yet my bride to her death wilt bring,\nThough a wife I should have that well thou knowest,\nAnd a child I should have within thy hall.\n\n36. \"Seek the smithy that thou didst set,\nThou shalt find the bellows sprinkled with blood;\nI smote off the heads of both thy sons,\nAnd their feet 'neath the sooty straps I hid.\n\n37. \"Their skulls, once hid by their hair, I took,\nSet them in silver and sent them to Nithuth;\nGems full fair from their eyes I fashioned,\nTo Nithuth's wife so wise I gave them.\n\n38. \"And from the teeth of the twain I wrought\nA brooch for the breast, to Bothvild I gave it;\nNow big with child does Bothvild go,\nThe only daughter ye two had ever.\"\n\n<i>Nithuth spake:</i>\n39. \"Never spakest thou word that worse could hurt me,\nNor that made me, Völund, more bitter for vengeance;\nThere is no man so high from thy horse to take thee,\nOr so doughty an archer as down to shoot thee,\nWhile high in the clouds thy course thou takest.\"\n\n40. Laughing Völund rose aloft,\nBut left in sadness Nithuth sat.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n41. Then spake Nithuth, lord of the Njars:\n\"Rise up, Thakkrath, best of my thralls,\nBid Bothvild come, the bright-browed maid,\nBedecked so fair, with her father to speak.\"\n\n42. . . . . . . . . . .\n\"Is it true, Bothvild, that which was told me;\nOnce in the isle with Völund wert thou?\"\n\n<i>Bothvild spake:</i>\n43. \"True is it, Nithuth, that which was told thee,\nOnce in the isle with Völund was I,\nAn hour of lust, alas it should be!\nNought was my might with such a man,\nNor from his strength could I save myself.\""
