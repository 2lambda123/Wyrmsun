	text = "~<The Ballad of Hamther~>\n\n1. Great the evils once that grew,\nWith the dawning sad of the sorrow of elves;\nIn early mom awake for men\nThe evils that grief to each shall bring.\n\n2. Not now, nor yet of yesterday was it,\nLong the time that since hath lapsed,\nSo that little there is that is half as old,\nSince Guthrun, daughter of Gjuki, whetted\nHer sons so young to Svanhild's vengeance.\n\n3. \"The sister ye had was Svanhild called,\nAnd her did Jormunrek trample with horses,\nWhite and black on the battle-way,\nGray, road-wonted, the steeds of the Goths.\n\n4. \"Little the kings of the folk are ye like,\nFor now ye are living alone of my race.\n\n5. \"Lonely am I as the forest aspen,\nOf kindred bare as the fir of its boughs,\nMy joys are all lost as the leaves of the tree\nWhen the scather of twigs from the warm day turns.\"\n\n6. Then Hamther spake forth, the high of heart:\n\"Small praise didst thou, Guthrun, to Hogni's deed give\nWhen they wakened thy Sigurth from out of his sleep,\nThou didst sit on the bed while his slayers laughed.\n\n7. \"Thy bed-covers white with blood were red\nFrom his wounds, and with gore of thy husband were wet;\nSo Sigurth was slain, by his corpse didst thou sit,\nAnd of gladness didst think not: 'twas Gunnar's doing.\n\n8. \"Thou wouldst strike at Atli by the slaying of Erp\nAnd the killing of Eitil; thine own grief was worse;\nSo should each one wield the wound-biting sword\nThat another it slays but smites not himself.\"\n\n9. Then did Sorli speak out, for wise was he ever:\n\"With my mother I never a quarrel will make;\nFull little in speaking methinks ye both lack;\nWhat askest thou, Guthrun, that will give thee no tears?\n\n10. \"For thy brothers dost weep, and thy boys so sweet,\nThy kinsmen in birth on the battlefield slain;\nNow, Guthrun, as; well for us both shalt thou weep,\nWe sit doomed on our steeds, and far hence shall we die.\"\n\n11. Then the fame-glad one-- on the steps she was--\nThe slender-fingered, spake with her son:\n\"Ye shall danger have if counsel ye heed not;\nBy two heroes alone shall two hundred of Goths\nBe bound or be slain in the lofty-walled burg.\"\n\n12. From the courtyard they fared, and fury they breathed;\nThe youths swiftly went o'er the mountain wet,\nOn their Hunnish steeds, death's vengeance to have.\n\n13. On the way they found the man so wise;\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\"What help from the weakling brown may we have?\"\n\n14. So answered them their half-brother then:\n\"So well may I my kinsmen aid\nAs help one foot from the other has.\"\n\n15. \"How may afoot its fellow aid,\nOr a flesh-grown hand another help?\"\n\n16. Then Erp spake forth, his words were few,\nAs haughty he sat on his horse's back:\n\"To the timid 'tis ill the way to tell.\"\nA bastard they the bold one called.\n\n17. From their sheaths they drew their shining swords,\nTheir blades, to the giantess joy to give;\nBy a third they lessened the might that was theirs,\nThe fighter young to earth they felled.\n\n18. Their cloaks they shook, their swords they sheathed,\nThe high-born men wrapped their mantles close.\n\n19. On their road they fared and an ill way found,\nAnd their sister's son on a tree they saw,\nOn the wind-cold wolf-tree west of the hall,\nAnd cranes'-bait crawled; none would care to linger.\n\n20. In the hall was din, the men drank deep,\nAnd the horses' hoofs could no one hear,\nTill the warrior hardy sounded his horn.\n\n21. Men came and the tale to Jormunrek told\nHow warriors helmed without they beheld:\n\"Take counsel wise, for brave ones are come,\nOf mighty men thou the sister didst murder.\"\n\n22. Then Jormunrek laughed, his hand laid on his beard,\nHis arms, for with wine he was warlike, he called for;\nHe shook his brown locks, on his white shield he looked,\nAnd raised high the cup of gold in his hand.\n\n23. \"Happy, methinks, were I to behold\nHamther and Sorli here in my hall;\nThe men would I bind with strings of bows,\nAnd Gjuki's heirs on the gallows hang.\"\n\n24. In the hall was clamor, the cups were shattered,\nMen stood in blood from the breasts of the Goths,\n\n25. Then did Hamther speak forth, the haughty of heart:\n\"Thou soughtest, Jormunrek, us to see,\nSons of one mother seeking thy dwelling;\nThou seest thy hands, thy feet thou beholdest,\nJormunrek, flung in the fire so hot.\"\n\n26. Then roared the king, of the race of the gods,\nBold in his armor, as roars a bear:\n\"Stone ye the men that steel will bite not,\nSword nor spear, the sons of Jonak.\"\n\n<i>Sorli spake:</i>\n27. \"Ill didst win, brother, when the bag thou didst open,\nOft from that bag came baleful counsel;\nHeart hast thou, Hamther, if knowledge thou hadst!\nA man without wisdom is lacking in much.\"\n\n<i>Hamther spake:</i>\n28. \"His head were now off if Erp were living,\nThe brother so keen whom we killed on our road,\nThe warrior noble,-- 'twas the Norns that drove me\nThe hero to slay who in fight should be holy.\n\n29. \"In fashion of wolves it befits us not\nAmongst ourselves to strive,\nLike the hounds of the Norns, that nourished were\nIn greed mid wastes so grim.\n\n30. \"We have greatly fought, o'er the Goths do we stand\nBy our blades laid low, like eagles on branches;\nGreat our fame though we die today or tomorrow;\nNone outlives the night when the Norris have spoken.\"\n\n31. Then Sorli beside the gable sank,\nAnd Hamther fell at the back of the house.\n\nThis is called the old ballad of Hamther."
