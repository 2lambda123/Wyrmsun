		text = "[i]The Ballad of Hamther[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe Hamthesmol, the concluding poem in the [i]Codex Regius[/i], is on the whole the worst preserved of all the poems in the collection. The origin of the story, the relation of the [i]Hamthesmol[/i] to the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i], and of both poems to the hypothetical \"old\" [i]Hamthesmol[/i], are outlined in the introductory note to the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i]. The[i] Hamthesmol [/i]as we have it is certainly not the \"old\" poem of that name; indeed it is so pronounced a patch work that it can hardly be regarded as a coherent poem at all. Some of the stanzas are in Fornyrthislag, some are in Malahattr, one (stanza 29) appears to be in Ljothahattr, and in many cases the words can be adapted to any known metrical form only by liberal emendation. That any one should have deliberately com posed such a poem seems quite incredible, and it is far more likely that some eleventh century narrator constructed a poem about the death of Hamther and Sorli by piecing together various fragments, and possibly adding a number of Malahattr stanzas of his own.\n\nIt has been argued, and with apparently sound logic, that our extant [i]Hamthesmol[/i] originated in Greenland, along with the [i]Atlamol[/i]. In any case, it can hardly have been put together before the latter part of the eleventh century, although the \"old\" [i]Hamthesmol[/i] undoubtedly long antedates this period. Many editors have attempted to pick out the parts of the extant poem which were borrowed from this older lay, but the condition of the text is such that it is by no means clear even what stanzas are in Fornyrthislag and what in Malahattr. Many editors, likewise, indicate gaps and omissions, but it seems doubtful whether the extant [i]Hamthesmol[/i] ever had a really consecutive quality, its component fragments having apparently been strung together with little regard for continuity. The notes indicate some of the more important editorial suggestions, but make no attempt to cover all of them, and the metrical form of the translation is often based on mere guesswork as to the character of the original lines and stanzas. Despite the chaotic state of the text, however, the underlying narrative is reasonably clear, and the story can be followed with no great difficulty."

Then did Sorli speak out, | for wise was he ever:\n\"With my mother I never | a quarrel will make;\nFull little in speaking | methinks ye both lack;\nWhat askest thou, Guthrun, | that will give thee no tears?\n\n10. \"For thy brothers dost weep, | and thy boys so sweet,\nThy kinsmen in birth | on the battlefield slain;\nNow, Guthrun, as; well | for us both shalt thou weep,\nWe sit doomed on our steeds, | and far hence shall we die.\"\n\n[8.

In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 21, and some editors take the word here rendered \"fame-glad one\" (hróþrgoþ) to be a proper name (Jormunrek's mother or his concubine). The [i]Volsungasaga[/i], however, indicates that Guthrun at this point \"had so fashioned their war-gear that iron would not bite into it, and she bade them to have nought to do with stones or other heavy things, and told them that it would be ill for them if they did not do as she said.\" The substance of this counsel may well have been conveyed in a passage lost after line 3, though the manuscript indicates no gap. It is by being stoned that Hamther and Sorli are killed (stanza 26). On the other hand, the second part of line 3 may possibly mean \"if silent ye are not,\" in which case the advice relates to Hamther's speech to Jormunrek and Sorli's reproach to him thereupon (stanzas 25 and 27). [i]Steps[/i]: the word in the original is doubtful. Line 3 is thoroughly obscure. Some editors make a separate stanza of lines 3-5, while others question line 5.\n\n12. Many editors assume the loss of a line after line 1. In several editions lines 2-3 are placed after line 2 of stanza 18. [i]Hunnish[/i]: the word meant little more than \"German\"; cf.

In the manuscript these two lines follow stanza 16; some editors insert them in place of lines 2-3 of stanza 11. The manuscript indicates no gap. [i]The man so wise[/i]: Erp, here represented as a son of Jonak but not of Guthrun, and hence a half-brother of Hamther and Sorli. There is nothing further to indicate whether or not he was born out of wedlock, as intimated in stanza 16. Some editors assign line 3 to Hamther, and some to Sorli.\n\n14. The stanza is obviously defective. Many editors add Erp's name in line 1, and insert between lines 2 and 1 a line based on stanza 15 and the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] paraphrase: \"As a flesh grown hand | another helps.\" In the [i]Volsungasaga[/i], after Erp's death, Hamther stumbles and saves himself from falling with his hand, whereupon he says: \"Erp spake truly; I had fallen had I not braced myself with my hand.\" Soon thereafter Sorli has a like experience, one foot slipping but the other saving him from a fall. \"Then they said that they had done ill to Erp, their brother.\"\n\n15. Many editions attach these two lines to stanza 14, while a few assume the loss of two lines.\n\n16. In the manuscript this stanza stands between stanzas 12 and 13. Some editors make line 4 a part of Erp's speech.]"

Most editors regard stanzas 28-30 as a speech by Hamther, but the manuscript does not indicate the speaker, and some editors assign one or two of the stanzas to Sorli.
