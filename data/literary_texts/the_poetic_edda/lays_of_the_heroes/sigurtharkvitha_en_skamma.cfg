		text = "[i]The Short Lay of Sigurth[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\n[i]Guthrunarkvitha I[/i] is immediately followed in the [i]Codex Regius[/i] by a long poem which in the manuscript bears the heading \"Sigurtharkvitha,\" but which is clearly referred to in the prose link between it and [i]Guthrunarkvitha I[/i] as the \"short\" Lay of Sigurth. The discrepancy between this reference and the obvious length of the poem has led to many conjectures, but the explanation seems to be that the \"long\" Sigurth lay, of which the [i]Brot[/i] is presumably a part, was materially longer even than this poem. The efforts to reduce the \"short\" Sigurth lay to dimensions which would justify the appellation in comparison with other poems in the collection, either by separating it into two poems or by the rejection of many stanzas as interpolations, have been utterly inconclusive.\n\nAlthough there are probably several interpolated passages, and indications of omissions are not lacking, the poem as we now have it seems to be a distinct and coherent unit. From the narrative point of view it leaves a good deal to be desired, for the reason that the poet's object was by no means to tell a story, with which his hearers were quite familiar, but to use the narrative simply as the background for vivid and powerful characterization. The lyric element, as Mogk points out, overshadows the epic throughout, and the fact that there are frequent confusions of narrative tradition does not trouble the poet at all.\n\nThe material on which the poem was based seems to have existed in both prose and verse form; the poet was almost certainly familiar with some of the other poems in the Eddic collection, with poems which have since been lost, and with the narrative prose traditions which never fully assumed verse form. The fact that he seems to have known and used the [i]Oddrunargratr[/i], which can hardly have been composed before 1050, and that in any case he introduces the figure of Oddrun, a relatively late addition to the story, dates the poem as late as the end of the eleventh century, or even the first half of the twelfth. There has been much discussion as to where it was composed, the debate centering chiefly on the reference to glaciers (stanza 8). There is something to be said in favor of Greenland"

No gap indicated in the manuscript; many editions place it between lines 3 and 4. [i]Menja's wealth[/i]: gold; the story of the mill Grotti, whereby the giantesses Menja and Fenja ground gold for King Frothi, is told in the [i]Grottasongr[/i].\n\n52. With this stanza begins Brynhild's prophesy of what is to befall Gunnar, Guthrun, Atli, and the many others involved in their fate. Line 3 is a proverbial expression meaning simply \"your troubles are not at an end.\"\n\n53. No gap is indicated in the manuscript; one suggestion for line 2 runs: \"Grimhild shall make her | to laugh once]"

Probably a line has been lost from this stanza. Grundtvig adds as a new first line: \"Her shalt thou find in the hall of Half.\" Some editions query line 3 as possibly spurious. [i]Svanhild[/i]: the figure of Svanhild is exceedingly old. The name means \"Swan-Maiden-Warrior,\" applying to just such mixtures of swan-maiden and Valkyrie as appear in the [i]Völundarkvitha[/i]. Originally part of a separate tradition, Svanhild appears first to have been incorporated in the Jormunrek (Ermanarich) story as the unhappy wife of that monarch, and much later to have been identified as the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun, thus linking the two sets of legends.\n\n55. Line 2 in the original is almost totally obscure. Line 4 should very possibly precede line 2, while line 5 looks like an unwarranted addition.\n\n56. This stanza probably ought to follow stanza 52, as it refers solely to) the winning of Brynhild by Gunnar and Sigurth. Müllenhoff regards stanzas 53-55 as interpolated. The manuscript indicates no gap after line 3.]"

Stanzas 57-58 seem to be the remains of two stanzas, but the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] paraphrase follows closely the form here given. Line 3 may well be spurious; line 5 has likewise been questioned. [i]Oddrun[/i]: this sister of Atli and Brynhild, known mainly through the [i]Oddrunargratr[/i], is a purely northern addition to the cycle, and apparently one of a relatively late date. She figures solely by reason of her love affair with Gunnar.\n\n58. Possibly two lines have been lost; many editions combine the two remaining lines with lines 1-3 of stanza 59. Concerning the manner of Gunnar's death cf. [i]Drap Niflunga[/i].\n\n59. Line 3 may well be spurious, as it is largely repetition. The manuscript has \"sofa\" (\"sleep\") in place of \"sona\" (\"sons\"), but the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] paraphrase says clearly \"sons.\" The slaying of Atli by Guthrun in revenge for his killing of her brothers is told in the two Atli lays. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 4-5, or else combine them with stanza 60.\n\n60.
