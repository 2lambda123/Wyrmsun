		text = "[i]The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe general subject of the Helgi lays is considered in the introduction to [i]Helgakvitha[/i] [i]Hjorvarthssonar[/i], and it is needless here to repeat the statements there made. The first lay of Helgi Hundingsbane is unquestionably one of the latest of the Eddic poems, and was composed probably not earlier than the second quarter of the eleventh century. It presents several unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is among the few essentially narrative poems in the whole collection, telling a consecutive story in verse, and, except for the abusive dialogue between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, which clearly was based on another and older poem, it does so with relatively little use of dialogue. It is, in fact, a ballad, and in the main an exceedingly vigorous one. The annotator, who added his prose narrative notes so freely in the other Helgi poems, here found nothing to do. The available evidence indicates that narrative verse was a relatively late development in Old Norse poetry, and it is significant that most of the poems which consist chiefly, not of dialogue, but of narrative stanzas, such as the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay and the two Atli lays, can safely be dated, on the basis of other evidence, after the year 1000.\n\nThe first Helgi Hundingsbane lay is again differentiated from most of the Eddic poems by the character of its language. It is full of those verbal intricacies which were the delight of the Norse skalds, and which made Snorri's dictionary of poetic phrases an absolute necessity. Many of these I have paraphrased in the translation; some I have simplified or wholly avoided. A single line will serve to indicate the character of this form of complex diction (stanza 56, line 4): \"And the horse of the giantess raven's-food had.\" This means simply that wolves (giantesses habitually rode on wolves) ate the bodies of the dead.\n\nExcept for its intricacies of diction, and the possible loss of a stanza here and there, the poem is comparatively simple. The story belongs in all its essentials to the Helgi tradition, with the Volsung cycle brought in only to the extent of making Helgi the son of Sigmund, and in the introduction of Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his sister Signy, in a passage which has"

		text = "little or nothing to do with the course of the narrative, and which looks like an expansion of a passage from some older poem, perhaps from the \"old Volsung lay\" to which the annotator of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay refers (prose after stanza 12). There are many proper names, some of which betray the confusion caused by the blending of the two sets of traditions; for example, Helgi appears indiscriminately as an Ylfing (which presumably he was before the Volsung story became involved) and as a Volsung. Granmar and his sons are called Hniflungs (Nibelungen) in stanza 50, though they seem to have had no connection with this race. The place names have aroused much debate as to the localization of the action, but while some of them probably reflect actual places, there is so much geographical confusion, and such a profusion of names which are almost certainly mythical, that it is hard to believe that the poet had any definite locations in mind.\n\n1. In olden days, | when eagles screamed,\nAnd holy streams | from heaven's crags fell,\nWas Helgi then, | the hero-hearted,\nBorghild's son, | in Bralund born.\n\n2. 'Twas night in the dwelling, | and Norns there came,\nWho shaped the life | of the lofty one;\nThey bade him most famed | of fighters all\nAnd best of princes | ever to be.\n\n[1. The manuscript contains the superscription: \"Here begins the lay of Helgi Hundingbane and h. (Hothbrodd?) The lay of the Volsungs.\" [i]Eagles[/i], etc.: the screaming of eagles and water pouring from heaven were portents of the birth of a hero. [i]Borghild[/i]: Sigmund's first wife; [i]Bralund[/i] was her home, not Sigmund's.\n\n2. [i]Norns[/i]: cf. [i]Voluspo[/i], 20 and note. Here it is the Norns who]"

Line 2 is largely guesswork, the manuscript being obscure. [i]Moon's[/i] [i]hall[/i]: the sky.\n\n4. [i]East[/i], etc.: the Norris give Helgi fame in the East, West, and North; in the North his renown is particularly to endure. This suggests that the poet was aware of the spread of the Helgi story over many lands. [i]Neri's[/i] [i]kinswoman[/i]: evidently one of the Norns, but nothing further is known of Neri, and the word may not be a proper name at all.\n\n5. The manuscript indicates no gap, but it looks as though something had been lost after line 2. [i]Ylfings'[/i] [i]son[/i]: Sigmund is evidently meant, though calling him an Ylfing (cf. [i]Hyndluljoth[/i], 11 and note) is a manifest error. Helgi, in the tradition as it came from Denmark, was undoubtedly an Ylfing, and the poet, in order to combine the two legends, has to treat the Ylfings and Volsungs as if they were the same family.]"

[i]Sigmund[/i]: the chief link between the Helgi and Sigurth stories. He was the son of Volsung, great-grandson of Othin. His children by his first wife, Borghild, were Helgi and Hamund (belonging to the Helgi cycle); his son by his second wife, Hjordis, was Sigurth. An incestuous connection with his sister, Signy (cf. Wagner's Siegmund and Sieglinde) resulted in the birth of Sinfjotli (cf. [i]Fra[/i] [i]Dautha[/i] [i]Sinfjotla[/i] and note).\n\n7. [i]The[/i] [i]king[/i]: Sigmund, who gives his son a symbol of the lands which he bestows on him. Regarding the leek, cf.

[i]Hringstathir[/i] (\"Ring-Stead\"): quite possibly the historical Ringsted, long a possession of the Danish kings, and thus a relic of the old Helgi tradition. [i]Hringstoth[/i] may be another form of the same name. [i]Solfjoll[/i] (\"Sun-Mountain\") and [i]Snæfjoll[/i] (\"Snow-Mountain\") are fictitious names. Regarding [i]Sigarsvoll[/i] cf. [i]Helgakvitha[/i] [i]Hjorvarthssonar[/i], stanzas 8 and 35. Saxo mentions a Danish king named Sigar, and the frequency with which the name appears in the Helgi poems may be taken as a reminiscence of Denmark. [i]Hotun[/i] (\"High Place\"): possibly the village of Tune in Seeland. [i]Himinvangar[/i] (\"Heaven's Field\"): an imaginary place. Blood-snake: a sword. [i]Sinfjotli[/i]: cf. note on stanza 6.]"

Hunding: the annotator (introductory prose to [i]Helgakvitha[/i] [i]Hundingsbana[/i] II) calls him king of Hundland, which shows no great originality. Saxo mentions a Hunding who was a Saxon king ruling in Jutland, probably the origin of Helgi's traditional foe.\n\n12. [i]Storm[/i], etc.: war.\n\n13.

[i]Southern[/i]: this variety of Valkyrie, like the swan maidens of the [i]Völundarkvitha[/i], was clearly regarded as of southern (i.e., German) origin. Here again there is a confusion of traditions; the Valkyries of the [i]Voluspo[/i] were as essentially Norse as any part of the older mythology. I doubt if a poet much earlier than the author of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay would have made his Sigrun, daughter of Hogni, a Valkyrie. It is to be noted that the same complication appears in the Sigurth story, where the undoubted Valkyrie, Brynhild-Sigrdrifa (the latter name is really only an epithet) is hopelessly mixed up with the quite human Brynhild, daughter of Buthli.\n\n18.

It has been suggested that this whole passage (stanzas 33-48) is an interpolation, perhaps from \"the Old Volsung lay.\" This may be, but it seems more probable that the poet used an older poem simply as the basis for this passage, borrowing a little but making up a great deal more.

Many editors combine lines 5-6 with all or part of stanza 52. Possibly Gothmund is not the speaker. [i]Mast-ring[/i] [i]harts[/i]: ships, so called from the ring attaching the yard to the mast. [i]Ylfings[/i]: cf. stanza 5 and note. [i]Sogn[/i]: this name, which actually belongs in western Norway, seems to have been used here with no particular significance.\n\n52. The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza; some editors combine lines 3-4 with all or part of stanza]"

[i]Fire-beasts[/i]: dragons,, i.e., ships. The Norse ships of war, as distinguished from merchant vessels, were often called dragons because of their shape and the carving of their stems.\n\n53. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker, and a few editors assume the loss of one or two lines embodying the phrase \"Hothbrodd spake.\" In the manuscript line 3, which many editors have suspected of being spurious, stands before line 2. Possibly lines 4-5 are the remains of a separate stanza. [i]Reginthing[/i] (\"The Great Council\"): apparently the council-place for the whole country, as distinct from the local council, or \"herathsthing.\" [i]Melnir[/i] (\"Bit-Bearer\"), [i]Mylnir[/i] (\"The Biter\") and [i]Spornvitnir[/i] {[i]sic:[/i] [i]Sporvitnir[/i] [i]above[/i]} (\"Spur-Wolf\"): horses' names. [i]Myrkwood[/i]: a not uncommon name for a dark forest; cf. [i]Lokasenna[/i], 42, and [i]Atlakvitha[/i], 3. [i]Sparinsheith[/i] (\"Sparin's Heath\"): nothing more is known of Sparin or his heath. [i]Flame[/i] [i]of[/i] [i]wounds[/i]: sword.\n\n54. [i]Hogni[/i]: the father of Sigrun; cf. [i]Helgakvitha[/i] [i]Hundingsbana[/i]]"

Swift as a storm | there smote together\nThe flashing blades | at Frekastein;\nEver was Helgi, | Hunding's slayer,\nFirst in the throng | where warriors fought;\n(Fierce in battle, | slow to fly,\nHard the heart | of the hero was.)\n\n56. From heaven there came | the maidens helmed,--\nThe weapon-clang grew,-- | who watched o'er the king;\nSpake Sigrun fair,-- | the wound-givers flew,\nAnd the horse of the giantess | raven's-food had:--\n\n57. \"Hail to thee, hero! | full happy with men,\nOffspring of Yngvi, | shalt ever live,\nFor thou the fearless | foe hast slain\nWho to many the dread | of death had brought.\n\n[II, 18. Of Hring and his sons nothing further is known. Volsungs: here for the first time the poet gives Helgi and Sinfjotli the family name to which, as sons of Sigmund Volsungsson, they are entitled.\n\n55. The manuscript indicates line 5 as the beginning of a new stanza, but many editors have rejected lines 5-6 as spurious, while others regard them as the first half of a stanza the last two lines of which have been lost.\n\n56. [i]Wound-givers[/i]: probably this means \"Valkyries,\" but there is considerable doubt as to the original word. [i]Horse[/i], etc.: i.e., the wolf (because giantesses customarily had wolves for their steeds) ate corpses (the food of birds of prey).\n\n57. [i]Yngvi[/i]: one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, and traditional ancestor of the Ynglings, with whom the Ylfings seem to have been confused (cf. [i]Hynduljoth[/i], {sic} 11 and note). The confusion between the Ylfings (or Ynglings) and Volsungs was carried far]"

Gering identifies the name of Yngvi with the god Freyr, but the Volsungs certainly claimed descent from Othin, not Freyr, and there is nothing to indicate that Helgi in the Danish tradition was supposed to be descended from Freyr, whereas his descent from Yngvi Halfdansson fits well with the rest of his story. However, cf. [i]Sigurtharkvitha[/i] [i]en[/i] [i]skamma[/i], 24 and note.\n\n58. This entire stanza may be an interpolation; nearly every edition has a different way of dealing with it. [i]Hringstathir[/i]: as this place had been given to Helgi by his father (cf. stanza 8 and note), the poet has apparently made a mistake in naming it here as a conquest from Granmar's sons, unless, indeed, they had previously captured it from Helgi, which seems unlikely.]"
