		text = "[i]The Greenland Lay of Atli[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThere are two Atli poems in the [i]Codex Regius[/i], the [i]Atlakvitha[/i] (Lay of Atli) and the [i]Atlamol[/i] (Ballad of Atli). The poems are not preserved or quoted in any other old manuscript, but they were extensively used by the compilers of the [i]Volsungasaga[/i]. In the manuscript superscription to each of these poems appears the word \"Greenland,\" which has given rise to a large amount of argument. The scribe was by no means infallible, and in this case his statement proves no more than that in the period round 1300 there was a tradition that these two poems originated in the Greenland settlement.\n\nThe two Atli poems deal with substantially the same material: the visit of the sons of Gjuki to Atli's court, their deaths, and the subsequent revenge of their sister, Guthrun, Atli's wife, on her husband. The shorter of the two, the [i]Atlakvitha[/i], tells the story with little elaboration; the [i]Atlamol[/i], with about the same narrative basis, adds many details, some of them apparently of the poet's invention, and with a romantic, not to say sentimental, quality quite lacking in the [i]Atlakvitha[/i]. Both poems are sharply distinguished from the rest of the collection by their metrical form, which is the Malahattr (used irregularly also in the [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i]), employed consistently and smoothly in the [i]Atlamol[/i], and with a considerable mixture of what appear to be Fornyrthislag lines (cf. Introduction) in the [i]Atlakvitha[/i].\n\nIt is altogether probable that both poems belong to the eleventh century, the shorter [i]Atlakvitha[/i] being generally dated from the first quarter thereof, and the longer [i]Atlamol[/i] some fifty years or more later. In each case the poet was apparently a Christian; in the [i]Atlamol[/i] (stanza 82) Guthrun expresses her readiness to die and \"go into another light,\" and in the [i]Atlakvitha[/i] there is frequent use of mythological names ([i]e.g.[/i], Valhall, Hlithskjolf) with an evident lack of understanding of their relation to the older gods. These facts fit the theory of a Greenland origin exceedingly well, for the Greenland settlement grew rapidly after the first explorations of Eirik the Red, which were in 982-985, and its most flourishing period was in the eleventh century. The internal evidence, particularly in the case of the [i]Atlamol[/i], points"

		text = "likewise to an origin remote from Iceland, Norway, and the \"Western Isles\"; and the two poems are sufficiently alike so that, despite the efforts of Finnur Jonsson and others to separate them, assigning one to Greenland and the other to Norway or else where, it seems probable that the manuscript statement is correct in both instances, and that the two Atli poems did actually originate in Greenland. An interesting account of this Greenland settlement is given in William Hovgaard's [i]Voyages of the Norsemen to America[/i], published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1914, and an extraordinarily vivid picture of the sufferings of the early settlers appears in Maurice Hewlett's [i]Thorgils[/i], taken from the [i]Floamannasaga[/i].\n\nFrom the standpoint of narrative material there is little that is distinctively Norse in either the [i]Atlakvitha[/i] or the [i]Atlamol[/i]. The story is the one outlined in the prose [i]Drap Niflunga[/i] (largely based on these two poems), representing almost exclusively the southern blending of the Attila and Burgundian legends (cf. introductory note to [i]Gripisspo[/i]). In the [i]Atlakvitha[/i], indeed, the word \"Burgundians\" is actually used. Brynhild is not mentioned in either poem; Sigurth's name appears but once, in the [i]Atlamol[/i]. Thus the material goes directly back to its South-Germanic origins, with little of the Northern making-over which resulted in such extensive changes in most parts of the Sigurth story. The general atmosphere, on the other hand, particularly in the [i]Atlamol[/i], is essentially Norse.\n\nAs has been said, the [i]Atlakvitha[/i] is metrically in a chaotic state, the normal Malahattr lines being frequently interspersed with lines and even stanzas which apparently are of the older Fornyrthislag type. How much of this confusion is due to faulty transmission is uncertain, but it has been suggested that the composer of the [i]Atlakvitha[/i] made over in Malahattr an older Atli poem in [i]Fornyrthislag[/i], and this suggestion has much to recommend it. That he worked on the basis of an older poem is, indeed, almost certain, for in oral prose tradition a far larger number of distinctively Norse traits would unquestionably have crept in than are found in the material of the [i]Atlakvitha[/i]. As for the [i]Atlamol[/i], here again the poet seems to have used an older poem as his basis, possibly the [i]Atlakvitha[/i] itself, although in that case he must have had other material as well, for there are frequent divergences in such matters as proper names. The translation of the [i]Atlakvitha[/i] is rendered peculiarly difficult "

She slew first Atli's sons, and thereafter she slew Atli, and burned the hall with his whole company. Concerning this was the following poem made:\n\n1.

Line 1 apparently is in Fornyrthislag. [i]Knefröth[/i] (the name is spelt in various ways, and its meaning is uncertain): in the [i]Atlamol[/i] (stanza 4) there are two messengers, one named Vingi and the other unnamed; the annotator combines the two versions in the [i]Drap Niflunga[/i]. [i]Benches[/i], etc.: the adjective rendered \"round the hearth,\" which etymologically it ought to mean, is made obscure by its application to \"helmets\" in stanzas 3 and 17.]"

Possibly they had given it to Atli in recompense for the death of his sister, Brynhild, and he now offered to restore it to them, or--as seems more likely--the poet was not very clear about its ownership himself. [i]Stems[/i]: i.e., the gilded stems of ships, carved like dragons,--an evident northern touch, if the word is correct, which is by no means certain . [i]Danp[/i]: this name was early applied to a mythical Danish king (cf.

Bugge thinks this stanza is spoken by Gunnar's terrified followers; Grundtvig assigns it to Hogni.

Then in came the shining one, |  . . . . .\n . . . . . | and drink she bore them;\nUnwilling and bitter | brought she food to the warrior,\nTill in scorn to the white-faced | Atli did she speak:\n\n39. \"Thou giver of swords, | of thy sons the hearts\nAll heavy with blood | in honey thou hast eaten;\nThou shalt stomach, thou hero, | the flesh of the slain,\nTo eat at thy feast, | and to send to thy followers.\n\n40. \"Thou shalt never call | to thy knees again\nErp or Eitil, | when merry with ale;\nThou shalt never see | in their seats again\nThe sharers of gold | their lances shaping,\n(Clipping the manes | or minding their steeds.)\"\n\n41. There was clamor on the benches, | and the cry of men,\n\n[38. No gap indicated in the manuscript, but the two fragments cannot be fitted together as one line. [i]The shining one[/i]: Guthrun.\n\n39. [i]Giver of swords[/i]: generous prince, i.e., Atli. [i]Honey[/i]: cf. [i]Guthrunarkvitha II[/i], 42. [i]To[/i] [i]send[/i] [i]to[/i] [i]thy[/i] [i]followers[/i]: literally, \"to send from thy high seat.\"\n\n40. Apparently a Fornyrthislag stanza. [i]Merry with ale[/i]: presumably this refers to Atli, but the manuscript reading makes it apply to the two boys. [i]Sharers of gold[/i]: princes. Line 5 is either interpolated or all that is left of a separate stanza.\n\n41. The text of the whole stanza has required a considerable amount of emendation. Lines 3-5 may have been expanded out of two lines, or line 5 may be an interpolation, possibly from stanza]"

		text = "The clashing of weapons, | and weeping of the Huns,\nSave for Guthrun only, | she wept not ever\nFor her bear-fierce brothers, | or the boys so dear,\nSo young and so unhappy, | whom with Atli she had.\n\n42. Gold did she scatter, | the swan-white one,\nAnd rings of red gold | to the followers gave she;\nThe fate she let grow, | and the shining wealth go,\nNor spared she the treasure | of the temple itself.\n\n43. Unwise then was Atli, | he had drunk to wildness,\nNo weapon did he have, | and of Guthrun bewared not;\nOft their play was better | when both in gladness\nEach other embraced | among princes all.\n\n44. With her sword she gave blood | for the bed to drink,\n\n[12 of the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i]. [i]Weapons[/i]: the word literally means \"good-weaving,\" and may refer to silken garments, but this hardly fits the noun here rendered \"clashing.\" [i]Wept not[/i]: cf. stanza 31 and note.\n\n42. Line 1 appears to be in Fornyrthislag. Guthrun distributes Atli's treasures among his followers apparently to prevent their wrath at the slaying of Erp and Eitil from turning against her; Atli, as stanza 43 shows, is too drunk to realize or prevent what she is doing.\n\n43. The second half of line 4 is apparently an error, but none of the editorial suggestions have improved it.\n\n44. Guthrun allows the dogs and the house-thralls, who had no part in Gunnar's death, to escape before she burns the dwelling]"

		text = "With her death-dealing hand, | and the hounds she loosed,\nThe thralls she awakened, | and a firebrand threw\nIn the door of the hall; | so vengeance she had.\n\n45. To the flames she gave all | who yet were within,\nAnd from Myrkheim had come | from the murder of Gunnar;\nThe timbers old fell, | the temple was in flames,\nThe dwelling of the Buthlungs, | and the shield-maids burned,\nThey were slain in the house, | in the hot flames they sank.\n\n46. Now the tale is all told, | nor in later time\nWill a woman in byrnie | avenge so her brothers;\nThe fair one to three | of the kings of the folk\nBrought the doom of death | ere herself she died.\n\nStill more is told in the Greenland ballad of Atli.\n\n[with all who are left therein. In [i]Atlamol[/i], stanzas 83-84, Atli is slain by a son of Hogni (Hniflung?) with Guthrun's help.\n\n45. Some editions transfer line 2 to stanza 37; others reject line 3 as interpolated. [i]Myrkheim[/i] (\"Dark-Home\"): probably identical with Myrkwood; cf. stanza 3. [i]Temple[/i]: probably both here and in stanza 42 the word means little more than the place where Atli's treasures were kept; the poet was by no means literal in his use of terms connected with the heathen religion. [i]Buthlungs[/i]: sons of Buthli, i.e., Atli and his family. [i]Shield-maids[/i]: cf. stanza 17 and note.\n\n46. The entire stanza is very likely a later addition. [i]Three kings[/i]: Atli and his two sons, Erp and Eitil.]"
