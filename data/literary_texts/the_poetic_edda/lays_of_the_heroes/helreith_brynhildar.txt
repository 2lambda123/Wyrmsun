	text = "~<Brynhild's Hell-Ride~>\n\nAfter the death of Brynhild there were made two bale-fires, the one for Sigurth, and that burned first, and on the other was Brynhild burned, and she was on a wagon which was covered with a rich cloth. Thus it is told, that Brynhild went in the wagon on Hel-way, and passed by a house where dwelt a certain giantess. The giantess spake:\n\n1. \"Thou shalt not further forward fare,\nMy dwelling ribbed with rocks across;\nMore seemly it were at thy weaving to stay,\nThan another's husband here to follow.\n\n2. \"What wouldst thou have from Valland here,\nFickle of heart, in this my house?\nGold-goddess, now, if thou wouldst know,\nHeroes' blood from thy hands hast washed.\"\n\n<i>Brynhild spake:</i>\n3. \"Chide me not, woman from rocky walls,\nThough to battle once I was wont to go;\nBetter than thou I shall seem to be,\nWhen men us two shall truly know.\"\n\n<i>The giantess spake:</i>\n4. \"Thou wast, Brynhild, Buthli's daughter,\nFor the worst of evils born in the world;\nTo death thou hast given Gjuki's children,\nAnd laid their lofty house full low.\"\n\n<i>Brynhild spake:</i>\n5. \"Truth from the wagon here I tell thee,\nWitless one, if know thou wilt\nHow the heirs of Gjuki gave me to be\njoyless ever, a breaker of oaths.\n\n6. \"Hild the helmed in Hlymdalir\nThey named me of old, all they who knew me.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n7. \"The monarch bold the swan-robes bore\nOf the sisters eight beneath an oak;\nTwelve winters I was, if know thou wilt,\nWhen oaths I yielded the king so young.\n\n8. \"Next I let the leader of Goths,\nHjalmgunnar the old, go down to hell,\nAnd victory brought to Autha's brother;\nFor this was Othin's anger mighty.\n\n9. \"He beset me with shields in Skatalund,\nRed and white, their rims o'erlapped;\nHe bade that my sleep should broken be\nBy him who fear had nowhere found.\n\n10. \"He let round my hall, that southward looked,\nThe branches' foe high-leaping burn;\nAcross it he bade the hero come\nWho brought me the gold that Fafnir guarded\n\n11. On Grani rode the giver of gold,\nWhere my foster-father ruled his folk;\nBest of all he seemed to be,\nThe prince of the Danes, when the people met.\n\n12. \"Happy we slept, one bed we had,\nAs he my brother born had been;\nEight were the nights when neither there\nLoving hand on the other laid.\n\n13. \"Yet Guthrun reproached me, Gjuki's daughter,\nThat I in Sigurth's arms had slept;\nThen did I hear what I would were hid,\nThat they had betrayed me in taking a mate.\n\n14. \"Ever with grief and all too long\nAre men and women born in the world;\nBut yet we shall live our lives together,\nSigurth and I. Sink down, Giantess!\""
