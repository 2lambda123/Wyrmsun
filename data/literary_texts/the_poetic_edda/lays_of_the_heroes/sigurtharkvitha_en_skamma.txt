	text = "~<The Short Lay of Sigurth~>\n\n1. Of old did Sigurth Gjuki seek,\nThe Volsung young, in battles victor;\nWell he trusted the brothers twain,\nWith mighty oaths among them sworn.\n\n2. A maid they gave him, and jewels many,\nGuthrun the young, the daughter of Gjuki;\nThey drank and spake full many a day,\nSigurth the young and Gjuki's sons.\n\n3. Thereafter went they Brynhild to woo,\nAnd so with them did Sigurth ride,\nThe Volsung young, in battle valiant,--\nHimself would have had her if all he had seen.\n\n4. The southern hero his naked sword,\nFair-flashing, let between them lie;\n(Nor would he come the maid to kiss;)\nThe Hunnish king in his arms ne'er held\nThe maiden he gave to Gjuki's sons.\n\n5. Ill she had known not in all her life,\nAnd nought of the sorrows of men she knew;\nBlame she had not, nor dreamed she should bear it,\nBut cruel the fates that among them came.\n\n6. By herself at the end of day she sat,\nAnd in open words her heart she uttered:\n\"I shall Sigurth have, the hero young,\nE'en though within my arms he die.\n\n7. \"The word I have spoken; soon shall I rue it,\nHis wife is Guthrun, and Gunnar's am I;\nIll Norns set for me long desire.\"\n\n8. Oft did she go with grieving heart\nOn the glacier's ice at even-tide,\nWhen Guthrun then to her bed was gone,\nAnd the bedclothes Sigurth about her laid.\n\n9. \" (Now Gjuki's child to her lover goes,)\nAnd the Hunnish king with his wife is happy;\nJoyless I am and mateless ever,\nTill cries from my heavy heart burst forth.\"\n\n10. In her wrath to battle she roused herself:\n\"Gunnar, now thou needs must lose\nLands of mine and me myself,\nNo joy shall I have with the hero ever.\n\n11. \"Back shall I fare where first I dwelt,\nAmong the kin that come of my race,\nTo wait there, sleeping my life away,\nIf Sigurth's death thou shalt not dare,\n(And best of heroes thou shalt not be.)\n\n12. \"The son shall fare with his father hence,\nAnd let not long the wolf-cub live;\nLighter to pay is the vengeance-price\nAfter the deed if the son is dead.\"\n\n13. Sad was Gunnar, and bowed with grief,\nDeep in thought the whole day through;\nYet from his heart it was ever hid\nWhat deed most fitting he should find,\n(Or what thing best for him should be,\nOr if he should seek the Volsung to slay,\nFor with mighty longing Sigurth he loved.)\n\n14. Much he pondered for many an hour;\nNever before was the wonder known\nThat a queen should thus her kingdom leave;\nIn counsel then did he Hogni call,\n(For him in truest trust he held.)\n\n15. \"More than all to me is Brynhild,\nButhli's child, the best of women;\nMy very life would I sooner lose\nThan yield the love of yonder maid.\n\n16. \"Wilt thou the hero for wealth betray?\n'Twere good to have the gold of the Rhine,\nAnd all the hoard in peace to hold,\nAnd waiting fortune thus to win.\"\n\n17. Few the words of Hogni were:\n\"Us it beseems not so to do,\nTo cleave with swords the oaths we swore,\nThe oaths we swore and all our vows.\n\n18. \"We know no mightier men on earth\nThe while we four o'er the folk hold sway,\nAnd while the Hunnish hero lives,\nNor higher kinship the world doth hold.\n\n19. \"If sons we five shall soon beget,\nGreat, methinks, our race shall grow;\nWell I see whence lead the ways;\nToo bitter far is Brynhild's hate.\"\n\n<i>Gunnar spake:</i>\n20. \"Gotthorm to wrath we needs must rouse,\nOur younger brother, in rashness blind;\nHe entered not in the oaths we swore,\nThe oaths we swore and all our vows.\"\n\n21. It was easy to rouse the reckless one.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nThe sword in the heart of Sigurth stood.\n\n22. In vengeance the hero rose in the hall,\nAnd hurled his sword at the slayer bold;\nAt Gotthorm flew the glittering steel\nOf Gram full hard from the hand of the king.\n\n23. The foeman cleft asunder fell,\nForward hands and head did sink,\nAnd legs and feet did backward fall.\n\n24. Guthrun soft in her bed had slept,\nSafe from care at Sigurth's side;\nShe woke to find her joy had fled,\nIn the blood of the friend of Freyr she lay.\n\n25. So hard she smote her hands together\nThat the hero rose up, iron-hearted:\n\"Weep not, Guthrun, grievous tears,\nBride so young, for thy brothers live.\n\n26. \"Too young, methinks, is my son as yet,\nHe cannot flee from the home of his foes;\nFearful and deadly the plan they found,\nThe counsel new that now they have heeded.\n\n27. \"No son will ride, though seven thou hast,\nTo the Thing as the son of their sister rides;\nWell I see who the ill has worked,\nOn Brynhild alone lies the blame for all.\n\n28. \"Above all men the maiden loved me,\nYet false to Gunnar I ne'er was found;\nI kept the oaths and the kinship I swore;\nOf his queen the lover none may call me.\n\n29. In a swoon she sank when Sigurth died;\nSo hard she smote her hands together\nThat all the cups in the cupboard rang,\nAnd loud in the courtyard cried the geese.\n\n30. Then Brynhild, daughter of Buthli, laughed,\nOnly once, with all her heart,\nWhen as she lay full loud she heard\nThe grievous wail of Gjuki's daughter.\n\n31. Then Gunnar, monarch of men, spake forth:\n\"Thou dost not laugh, thou lover of hate,\nIn gladness there, or for aught of good;\nWhy has thy face so white a hue,\nMother of ill? Foredoomed thou art.\n\n32. \"A worthier woman wouldst thou have been\nIf before thine eyes we had Atli slain;\nIf thy brother's bleeding body hadst seen\nAnd the bloody wounds that thou shouldst End.\"\n\n<i>Brynhild spake:</i>\n33. \"None mock thee, Gunnar! thou hast mightily fought,\nBut thy hatred little doth Atli heed;\nLonger than thou, methinks, shall he live,\nAnd greater in might shall he ever remain.\n\n34. \"To thee I say, and thyself thou knowest,\nThat all these ills thou didst early shape;\nNo bonds I knew, nor sorrow bore,\nAnd wealth I had in my brother's home.\n\n35. \"Never a husband sought I to have,\nBefore the Gjukungs fared to our land;\nThree were the kings on steeds that came,--\nNeed of their journey never there was.\n\n36. \"To the hero great my troth I gave\nWho gold-decked sat on Grani's back;\nNot like to thine was the light of his eyes,\n(Nor like in form and face are ye,)\nThough kingly both ye seemed to be.\n\n37. \"And so to me did Atli say\nThat share in our wealth I should not have,\nOf gold or lands, if my hand I gave not;\n(More evil yet, the wealth I should yield,)\nThe gold that he in my childhood gave me,\n(The wealth from him in my youth I had.)\n\n38. \"Oft in my mind I pondered much\nIf still I should fight, and warriors fell,\nBrave in my byrnie, my brother defying;\nThat would wide in the world be known,\nAnd sorrow for many a man would make.\n\n39. \"But the bond at last I let be made,\nFor more the hoard I longed to have,\nThe rings that the son of Sigmund won;\nNo other's treasure e'er I sought.\n\n40. \"One-alone of all I loved,\nNor changing heart I ever had;\nAll in the end shall Atli know,\nWhen he hears I have gone on the death-road hence.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n41. \"Never a wife of fickle will\nYet to another man should yield.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nSo vengence for all my ills shall come.\"\n\n42, Up rose Gunnar, the people's ruler,\nAnd flung his arms round her neck so fair;\nAnd all who came, of every kind,\nSought to hold her with all their hearts.\n\n43. But back she cast all those who came,\nNor from the long road let them hold her;\nIn counsel then did he Hogni call:\n\"Of wisdom now full great is our need.\n\n44. \"Let the warriors here in the hall come forth,\nThine and mine, for the need is mighty,\nIf haply the queen from death they may hold,\nTill her fearful thoughts with time shall fade.\"\n\n45. (Few the words of Hogni were:)\n\"From the long road now shall ye hold her not,\nThat born again she may never be!\nFoul she came from her mother forth,\nAnd born she was for wicked deeds,\n(Sorrow to many a man to bring.)\"\n\n46. From the speaker gloomily Gunnar turned,\nFor the jewel-bearer her gems was dividing;\nOn all her wealth her eyes were gazing,\nOn the bond-women slain and the slaughtered slaves.\n\n47. Her byrnie of gold she donned, and grim\nWas her heart ere the point of her sword had pierced it;\nOn the pillow at last her head she laid,\nAnd, wounded, her plan she pondered o'er.\n\n48. \"Hither I will that my women come\nWho gold are fain from me to get;\nNecklaces fashioned fair to each\nShall I give, and cloth, and garments bright.\"\n\n49. Silent were all as so she spake,\nAnd all together answer made:\n\"Slain are enough; we seek to live,\nNot thus thy women shall honor win.\"\n\n50. Long the woman, linen-decked, pondered,--\n--Young she was,-- and weighed her words:\n\"For my sake now shall none unwilling\nOr loath to die her life lay down.\n\n51. \"But little of gems to gleam on your limbs\nYe then shall find when forth ye fare\nTo follow me, or of Menja's wealth.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n52. \"Sit now, Gunnar! for I shall speak\nOf thy bride so fair and so fain to die;\nThy ship in harbor home thou hast not,\nAlthough my life I now have lost.\n\n53. \"Thou shalt Guthrun requite more quick than thou thinkest,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nThough sadly mourns the maiden wise\nWho dwells with the king, o'er her husband dead.\n\n54. \"A maid shall then the mother bear;\nBrighter far than the fairest day\nSvanhild shall be, or the beams of the sun.\n\n55. \"Guthrun a noble husband thou givest,\nYet to many a warrior woe will she bring,\nNot happily wedded she holds herself;\nHer shall Atli hither seek,\n(Buthli's son, and brother of mine.)\n\n56. \"Well I remember how me ye treated\nWhen ye betrayed me with treacherous wiles;\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nLost was my joy as long as I lived.\n\n57. \"Oddrun as wife thou fain wouldst win,\nBut Atli this from thee withholds;\nYet in secret tryst ye twain shall love;\nShe shall hold thee dear, as I had done\nIf kindly fate to us had fallen.\n\n58. \"Ill to thee shall Atli bring,\nWhen he casts thee down in the den of snakes.\n\n59. \"But soon thereafter Atli too\nHis life, methinks, as thou shalt lose,\n(His fortune lose and the lives of his sons;)\nHim shall Guthrun, grim of heart,\nWith the biting blade in his bed destroy.\n\n60. \"It would better beseem thy sister fair\nTo follow her husband first in death,\nIf counsel good to her were given,\nOr a heart akin to mine she had.\n\n61. \"Slowly I speak,-- but for my sake\nHer life, methinks, she shall not lose;\nShe shall wander over the tossing waves,\nTo where Jonak rules his father's realm.\n\n62. \"Sons to him she soon shall bear,\nHeirs therewith of Jonak's wealth;\nBut Svanhild far away is sent,\nThe child she bore to Sigurth brave.\n\n63. \"Bikki's word her death shall be,\nFor dreadful the wrath of Jormunrek;\nSo slain is all of Sigurth's race,\nAnd greater the woe of Guthrun grows.\n\n64. \"Yet one boon I beg of thee,\nThe last of boons in my life it is:\nLet the pyre be built so broad in the field\nThat room for us all will ample be,\n(For us who slain with Sigurth are.)\n\n65. \"With shields and carpets cover the pyre,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nShrouds full fair, and fallen slaves,\nAnd besides the Hunnish hero burn me.\n\n66. \"Besides the Hunnish hero there\nSlaves shall burn, full bravely decked,\nTwo at his head and two at his feet,\nA brace of hounds and a pair of hawks,\nFor so shall all be seemly done.\n\n67. \"Let between us lie once more\nThe steel so keen, as so it lay\nWhen both within one bed we were,\nAnd wedded mates by men were called.\n\n68. \"The door of the hall shall strike not the heel\nOf the hero fair with flashing rings,\nIf hence my following goes with him;\nNot mean our faring forth shall be.\n\n69. \"Bond-women five shall follow him,\nAnd eight of my thralls, well-born are they,\nChildren with me, and mine they were\nAs gifts that Buthli his daughter gave.\n\n70. \"Much have I told thee, and more would say\nIf fate more space for speech had given;\nMy voice grows weak, my wounds are swelling;\nTruth I have said, and so I die.\""
