	text = "~<The Ballad of Regin~>\n\nSigurth went to Hjalprek's stud and chose for himself a horse, who thereafter was called Grani. At that time Regin, the son of Hreithmar, was come to Hjalprek's home; he was more ingenious than all other men, and a dwarf in stature; he was wise, fierce and skilled in magic. Regin undertook Sigurth's bringing up and teaching, and loved him much. He told Sigurth of his forefathers, and also of this: that once Othin and Hönir and Loki had come to Andvari's waterfall, and in the fall were many fish. Andvari was a dwarf, who had dwelt long in the waterfall in the shape of a pike, and there he got his food. \"Otr was the name of a brother of ours,\" said. Regin, \"who often went into the fall in the shape of an otter; he had caught a salmon, and sat on the high bank eating it with his eyes shut. Loki threw a stone at him and killed him; the gods thought they bad had great good luck, and stripped the skin off the otter. That same evening they sought a night's lodging at Hreithmar's house, and showed their booty. Then we seized them, and told them, as ransom for their lives, to fill the otter skin with gold, and completely cover it outside as well with red gold. Then they sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron and got her net, and went then to Andvari's fall and cast the net in front of the pike, and the pike leaped into the net.\" Then Loki said:\n\n1. \"What is the fish that runs in the flood,\nAnd itself from ill cannot save?\nIf thy head thou wouldst from hell redeem,\nFind me the water's flame.\"\n\n<i>Andvari spake:</i>\n2. \"Andvari am I, and Oin my father,\nIn many a fall have I fared;\nAn evil Norn in olden days\nDoomed me In waters to dwell.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n3. \"Andvari, say, if thou seekest still\nTo live in the land of men,\nWhat payment is set for the sons of men\nWho war with lying words?\"\n\n<i>Andvari spake:</i>\n4. \"A mighty payment the men must make\nWho in Valthgelmir's waters wade;\nOn a long road lead the lying words\nThat one to another utters.\"\n\nLoki saw all the gold that Andvari had. But when he had brought forth all the gold, he held back one ring, and Loki took this from him. The dwarf went into his rocky hole and said:\n\n5. \"Now shall the gold that Gust once had\nBring their death to brothers twain,\nAnd evil be for heroes eight;\njoy of my wealth shall no man win.\"\n\nThe gods gave Hreithmar the gold, and filled up the otter-skin, and stood it on its feet. Then the gods had to heap up gold and hide it. And when that was done, Hreithmar came forward and saw a single whisker, and bade them cover it. Then Othin brought out the ring Andvaranaut and covered the hair. Then Loki said:\n\n6. \"The gold is given, and great the price\nThou hast my head to save;\nBut fortune thy sons shall find not there,\nThe bane of ye both it is.\"\n\n<i>Hreithmar spake:</i>\n7. \"Gifts ye gave, but ye gave not kindly,\nGave not with hearts that were whole;\nYour lives ere this should ye all have lost,\nIf sooner this fate I had seen.\"\n\n<i>Loki spake:</i>\n8. \"Worse is this that methinks I see,\nFor a maid shall kinsmen clash;\nHeroes unborn thereby shall be,\nI deem, to hatred doomed.\"\n\n<i>Hreithmar spake:</i>\n9. \"The gold so red shall I rule, methinks,\nSo long as I shall live;\nNought of fear for thy threats I feel,\nSo get ye hence to your homes.\"\n\nFafnir and Regin asked Hreithmar for a share of the wealth that was paid for the slaying of their brother, Otr. This he refused, and Fafnir thrust his sword through the body of his father, Hreithmar, while he was sleeping. Hreithmar called to his daughters:\n\n10. \"Lyngheith and Lofnheith, fled is my life,\nAnd mighty now is my need!\"\n\n<i>Lyngheith spake:</i>\n\"Though a sister loses her father, seldom\nRevenge on her brother she brings.\"\n\n<i>Hreithmar spake:</i>\n11. \"A daughter, woman with wolf's heart, bear,\nIf thou hast no son with the hero brave;\nIf one weds the maid, for the need is mighty,\nTheir son for thy hurt may vengeance seek.\"\n\nThen Hreithmar died, and Fafnir took all the gold. Thereupon Regin asked to have his inheritance from his father, but Fafnir refused this. Then Regin asked counsel of Lyngheith, his sister, how he should win his inheritance. She said:\n\n12. \"In friendly wise the wealth shalt thou ask\nOf thy brother, and better will;\nNot seemly is it to seek with the sword\nFafnir's treasure to take.\"\n\nAll these happenings did Regin tell to Sigurth.\n\nOne day, when he came to Regin's house, he was gladly welcomed. Regin said:\n\n13. \"Hither the son of Sigmund is come,\nThe hero eager, here to our hall;\nHis courage is more than an ancient man's,\nAnd battle I hope from the hardy wolf.\n\n14. \"Here shall I foster the fearless prince,\nNow Yngvi's heir to us is come;\nThe noblest hero beneath the sun,\nThe threads of his fate all lands enfold.\"\n\nSigurth was there continually with Regin, who said to Sigurth that Fafnir lay at Gnitaheith, and was in the shape of a dragon. He had a fear-helm, of which all living creatures were terrified. Regin made Sigurth the sword which was called Gram; it was so sharp that when he thrust it down into the Rhine, and let a strand of wool drift against it with the stream, it cleft the strand asunder as if it were water. With this sword Sigurth cleft asunder Regin's anvil. After that Regin egged Sigurth on to slay Fafnir, but he said:\n\n15. \"Loud will the sons of Hunding laugh,\nWho low did Eylimi lay in death,\nIf the hero sooner seeks the red\nRings to find than his father's vengeance.\"\n\nKing Hjalprek gave Sigurth a fleet for the avenging of his father. They ran into a great storm, and were off a certain headland. A man stood on the mountain, and said:\n\n16. \"Who yonder rides on Rævil's steeds,\nO'er towering waves and waters wild?\nThe sail-horses all with sweat are dripping,\nNor can the sea-steeds the gale withstand.\"\n\n<i>Regin answered:</i>\n17. \"On the sea-trees here are Sigurth and I,\nThe storm wind drives us on to our death;\nThe waves crash down on the forward deck,\nAnd the roller-steeds sink; who seeks our names?\"\n\n<i>The Man spake:</i>\n18. \"Hnikar I was when Volsung once\nGladdened the ravens and battle gave;\nCall me the Man from the Mountain now,\nFeng or Fjolnir; with you will I fare.\"\n\nThey sailed to the land, and the man went on board the ship, and the storm subsided. Sigurth spake:\n\n19. \"Hnikar, say, for thou seest the fate\nThat to gods and men is given;\nWhat sign is fairest for him who fights,\nAnd best for the swinging of swords?\"\n\n<i>Hnikar spake:</i>\n20. \"Many the signs, if men but knew,\nThat are good for the swinging of swords;\nIt is well, methinks, if the warrior meets\nA raven black on his road.\n\n21. \"Another it is if out thou art come,\nAnd art ready forth to fare,\nTo behold on the path before thy house\nTwo fighters greedy of fame.\n\n22. \"Third it is well if a howling wolf\nThou hearest under the ash;\nAnd fortune comes if thy foe thou seest\nEre thee the hero beholds.\n\n23. \"A man shall fight not when he must face\nThe moon's bright sister setting late;\nWin he shall who well can see,\nAnd wedge-like forms his men for the fray.\n\n24. \"Foul is the sign if thy foot shall stumble\nAs thou goest forth to fight;\nGoddesses baneful at both thy sides\nWill that wounds thou shalt get.\n\n25. \"Combed and washed shall the wise man go,\nAnd a meal at mom shall take;\nFor unknown it is where at eve he may be;\nIt is ill thy luck to lose.\"\n\nSigurth had a great battle with Lyngvi, the son of Hunding, and his brothers; there Lyngvi fell, and his two brothers with him. After the battle Regin said:\n\n26. \"Now the bloody eagle with biting sword\nIs carved on the back of Sigmund's killer;\nFew were more fierce in fight than his son,\nWho reddened the earth and gladdened the ravens.\"\n\nSigurth went home to Hjalprek's house; thereupon Regin egged him on to <a href='literary_text:fafnismol'>fight with Fafnir</a>."
