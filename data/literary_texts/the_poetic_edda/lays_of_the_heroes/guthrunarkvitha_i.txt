	text = "~<The First Lay of Guthrun~>\n\nGuthrun sat by the dead Sigurth; she did not weep as other women, but her heart was near to bursting with grief. The men and women came to her to console her, but that was not easy to do. It is told of men that Guthrun had eaten of Fafnir's heart, and that she under stood the speech of birds. This is a poem about Guthrun.\n\n1. Then did Guthrun think to die,\nWhen she by Sigurth sorrowing sat;\nTears she had not, nor wrung her hands,\nNor ever wailed, as other women.\n\n2. To her the warriors wise there came,\nLonging her heavy woe to lighten;\nGrieving could not Guthrun weep,\nSo sad her heart, it seemed, would break.\n\n3. Then the wives of the warriors came,\nGold-adorned, and Guthrun sought;\nEach one then of her own grief spoke,\nThe bitterest pain she had ever borne.\n\n4. Then spake Gjaflaug, Gjuki's sister:\n\"Most joyless of all on earth am I;\nHusbands five were from me taken,\n(Two daughters then, and sisters three,)\nBrothers eight, yet I have lived.\"\n\n5. Grieving could not Guthrun weep,\nSuch grief she had for her husband dead,\nAnd so grim her heart by the hero's body.\n\n6. Then Herborg spake, the queen of the Huns:\n\"I have a greater grief to tell;\nMy seven sons in the southern land,\nAnd my husband, fell in fight all eight.\n(Father and mother and brothers four\nAmid the waves the wind once smote,\nAnd the seas crashed through the sides of the ship.)\n\n7. \"The bodies all with my own hands then\nI decked for the grave, and the dead I buried;\nA half-year brought me this to bear;\nAnd no one came to comfort me.\n\n8. \"Then bound I was, and taken in war,\nA sorrow yet in the same half-year;\nThey bade me deck and bind the shoes\nOf the wife of the monarch every morn.\n\n9. \"In jealous rage her wrath she spake,\nAnd beat me oft with heavy blows;\nNever a better lord I knew,\nAnd never a woman worse I found.\"\n\n10. Grieving could not Guthrun weep,\nSuch grief she had for her husband dead,\nAnd so grim her heart by the hero's body.\n\n11. Then spake Gollrond, Gjuki's daughter:\n\"Thy wisdom finds not, my foster-mother,\nThe way to comfort the wife so young.\"\nShe bade them uncover the warrior's corpse.\n\n12. The shroud she lifted from Sigurth, laying\nHis well-loved head on the knees of his wife:\n\"Look on thy loved one, and lay thy lips\nTo his as if yet the hero lived.\"\n\n13. Once alone did Guthrun look;\nHis hair all clotted with blood beheld,\nThe blinded eyes that once shone bright,\nThe hero's breast that the blade had pierced.\n\n14. Then Guthrun bent, on her pillow bowed,\nHer hair was loosened, her cheek was hot,\nAnd the tears like raindrops downward ran.\n\n15. Then Guthrun, daughter of Gjuki, wept,\nAnd through her tresses flowed the tears;\nAnd from the court came the cry of geese,\nThe birds so fair of the hero's bride.\n\n16. Then Gollrond spake, the daughter of Gjuki:\n\"Never a greater love I knew\nThan yours among all men on earth;\nNowhere wast happy, at home or abroad,\nSister mine, with Sigurth away.\"\n\n<i>Guthrun spake:</i>\n17. \"So was my Sigurth o'er Gjuki's sons\nAs the spear-leek grown above the grass,\nOr the jewel bright borne on the band,\nThe precious stone that princes wear.\n\n18. \"To the leader of men I loftier seemed\nAnd higher than all of Herjan's maids;\nAs little now as the leaf I am\nOn the willow hanging; my hero is dead.\n\n19. \"In his seat, in his bed, I see no more\nMy heart's true friend; the fault is theirs,\nThe sons of Gjuki, for all my grief,\nThat so their sister sorely weeps.\n\n20. \"So shall your land its people lose\nAs ye have kept your oaths of yore;\nGunnar, no joy the gold shall give thee,\n(The rings shall soon thy slayers be,)\nWho swarest oaths with Sigurth once.\n\n21. \"In the court was greater gladness then\nThe day my Sigurth Grani saddled,\nAnd went forth Brynhild's hand to win,\nThat woman ill, in an evil hour.\"\n\n22. Then Brynhild spake, the daughter of Buthli:\n\"May the witch now husband and children want\nWho, Guthrun, loosed thy tears at last,\nAnd with magic today hath made thee speak.\"\n\n23. Then Gollrond, daughter of Gjuki, spake:\n\"Speak not such words, thou hated woman;\nBane of the noble thou e'er hast been,\n(Borne thou art on an evil wave,\nSorrow hast brought to seven kings,)\nAnd many a woman hast loveless made.\"\n\n24. Then Brynhild, daughter of Buthli, spake:\n\"Atli is guilty of all the sorrow,\n(Son of Buthli and brother of mine,)\nWhen we saw in the hall of the Hunnish race\nThe flame of the snake's bed flash round the hero;\n(For the journey since full sore have I paid,\nAnd ever I seek the sight to forget.)\"\n\n25. By the pillars she stood, and gathered her strength,\nFrom the eyes of Brynhild, Buthli's daughter,\nFire there burned, and venom she breathed,\nWhen the wounds she saw on Sigurth then.\n\nGuthrun went thence away to a forest in the waste, and journeyed all the way to Denmark, and was there seven half-years with Thora, daughter of Hokon. Brynhild would not live after Sigurth. She had eight of her thralls slain and five serving-women. Then she killed her self with a sword, as is told in the Short Lay of Sigurth."
