		text = "[i]The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nIt has already been pointed out (introductory note to [i]Guthrunarkvitha I[/i]) that the tradition of Guthrun's lament was known wherever the Sigurth story existed, and that this lament was probably one of the earliest parts of the legend to assume verse form. Whether it reached the North as verse cannot, of course, be determined, but it is at least possible that this was the case, and in any event it is clear that by the tenth and eleventh centuries there were a number of Norse poems with Guthrun's lament as the central theme. Two of these are included in the Eddic collection, the second one being unquestionably much the older. It is evidently the poem referred to by the annotator in the prose note following the [i]Brot[/i] as \"the old Guthrun lay,\" and its character and state of preservation have combined to lead most commentators to date it as early as the first half of the tenth century, whereas [i]Guthrunarkvitha I[/i] belongs a hundred years later.\n\nThe poem has evidently been preserved in rather bad shape, with a number of serious omissions and some interpolations, but in just this form it lay before the compilers of the [i]Volsungasaga[/i], who paraphrased it faithfully, and quoted five of its stanzas. The interpolations are on the whole unimportant; the omissions, while they obscure the sense of certain passages, do not destroy the essential continuity of the poem, in which Guthrun reviews her sorrows from the death of Sigurth through the slaying of her brothers to Atli's dreams foretelling the death of their sons. It is, indeed, the only Norse poem of the Sigurth cycle antedating the year 1000 which has come down to us in anything approaching complete form; the [i]Reginsmol[/i], [i]Fafnismol[/i], and [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i] are all collections of fragments, only a short bit of the \"long\" Sigurth lay remains, and the others--[i]Gripisspo[/i], [i]Guthrunarkvitha I[/i] and [i]III[/i], [i]Sigurtharkvitha en skamma[/i], [i]Helreith Brynhildar[/i], [i]Oddrunargratr[/i], [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i], [i]Hamthesmol[/i], and the two Atli lays--are all generally dated from the eleventh and even the twelfth centuries.\n\nAn added reason for believing that [i]Guthrunarkvitha II[/i] traces its origin back to a lament which reached the North"

		text = "from Germany in verse form is the absence of most characteristic Norse additions to the narrative, except in minor details. Sigurth is slain in the forest, as \"German men say\" (cf. [i]Brot[/i], concluding prose); the urging of Guthrun by her mother 2nd brothers to become Atli's wife, the slaying of the Gjukungs (here only intimated, for at that point something seems to have been lost), and Guthrun's prospective revenge on Atli, all belong directly to the German tradition (cf. introductory note to [i]Gripisspo[/i]).\n\nIn the [i]Codex Regius[/i] the poem is entitled simply [i]Guthrunarkvitha[/i]; the numeral has been added in nearly all editions to distinguish this poem from the other two Guthrun lays, and the phrase \"the old\" is borrowed from the annotator's comment in the prose note at the end of the [i]Brot[/i].\n\n__________________\n\nKing Thjothrek was with Atli, and had lost most of his men. Thjothrek and Guthrun lamented their griefs together. She spoke to him, saying:\n\n1. A maid of maids | my mother bore me,\nBright in my bower, | my brothers I loved,\nTill Gjuki dowered | me with gold,\nDowered with gold, | and to Sigurth gave me.\n\n[[i]Prose[/i]. [i]Thjothrek[/i]: the famous Theoderich, king of the Ostrogoths, who became renowned in German story as Dietrich von Bern. The German tradition early accepted the anachronism of bringing together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453, and Theoderich. who was born about 455, and adding thereto Ermanarich (Jormunrek), king of the Goths, who died about 376. Ermanarich, in German tradition, replaced Theoderich's actual enemy, Odovakar, and it was in battle with Jormunrek (i. e., Odovakar) that Thjothrek is here said to have lost most WE his men. The annotator found the material for this note in [i]Guthrunarkvitha III[/i], in which Guthrun is accused of having Thjothrek as her lover. At the time when [i]Guthrunarkvitha II[/i]]"

A Thora appears in [i]Hyndluljoth[/i], 18, as the wife of Dag, one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, the most famous of Denmark's mythical kings, and one of her sons is Alf (Hoalf?).]"

Some commentators assume, as the Volsungasaga does, that these messengers went with the Gjukungs to Denmark in search of Guthrun, but it seems more likely that a transitional stanza has dropped out after stanza 19, and that Guthrun received Atli's emissaries in her brothers' home. [i]Long-beards[/i]: the word may actually mean Langobards or Lombards, but, if it does, it is presumably without any specific significance here. Certainly the names in the interpolated two lines do not fit either Lombards or Huns, for Valdar is identified as a Dane, and Jarizleif and Jarizskar are apparently Slavic. The manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza.\n\n21. [i]Each[/i]: the reference is presumably to Gunnar and Hogni, and perhaps also Grimhild, I suspect that this stanza belongs before stanza 20.\n\n22. Stanzas 22-25 describe the draught of forgetfulness which Grimhild gives Guthrun, just as she gave one to Sigurth (in one version of the story) to make him forget Brynhild. The draught does not seem to work despite Guthrun's statement in stanza 25 (cf. stanza 30), for which reason Vigfusson, not unwisely, places stanzas 22-25 after stanza 34.
