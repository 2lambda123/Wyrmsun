	text = "~<The Ballad of The Victory-Bringer~>\n\nSigurth rode up on Hindarfjoll and turned southward toward the land of the Franks. On the mountain he saw a great light, as if fire were burning, and the glow reached up to heaven. And when he came thither, there stood a tower of shields, and above it was a banner. Sigurth went into the shield-tower, and saw that a man lay there sleeping with all his war-weapons. First he took the helm from his head, and then he saw that it was a woman. The mail-coat was as fast as if it had grown to the flesh. Then he cut the mail-coat from the head-opening downward, and out to both the arm-holes. Then he took the mail-coat from her, and she awoke, and sat up and saw Sigurth, and said:\n\n1. \"What bit through the byrnie? how was broken my sleep?\nWho made me free of the fetters pale?\"\n\n<i>He answered:</i>\n\"Sigmund's son, with Sigurth's sword,\nThat late with flesh hath fed the ravens.\"\n\nSigurth sat beside her and asked her name. She took a horn full of mead and gave him a memory-draught.\n\n2. \"Hail, day! Hail, sons of day!\nAnd night and her daughter now!\nLook on us here with loving eyes,\nThat waiting we victory win.\n\n3. \"Hail to the gods! Ye goddesses, hail,\nAnd all the generous earth!\nGive to us wisdom and goodly speech,\nAnd healing hands, life-long.\n\n4. \"Long did I sleep, my slumber was long,\nAnd long are the griefs of life;\nOthin decreed that I could not break\nThe heavy spells of sleep.\"\n\nHer name was Sigrdrifa, and she was a Valkyrie. She said that two kings fought in battle; one was called Hjalmgunnar, an old man but a mighty warrior, and Othin had promised him the victory, and\n\nThe other was Agnar, brother of Autha,\nNone he found who fain would shield him.\n\nSigrdrifa, slew Hjalmgunnar in the battle, and Othin pricked her with the sleep-thorn in punishment for this, and said that she should never thereafter win victory in battle, but that she should be wedded. \"And I said to him that I had made a vow in my turn, that I would never marry a man who knew the meaning of fear.\" Sigurth answered and asked her to teach him wisdom, if she knew of what took place in all the worlds. Sigrdrifa said:\n\n5. \"Beer I bring thee, tree of battle,\nMingled of strength and mighty fame;\nCharms it holds and healing signs,\nSpells full good, and gladness-runes.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n6. Winning-runes learn, if thou longest to win,\nAnd the runes on thy sword-hilt write;\nSome on the furrow, and some on the flat,\nAnd twice shalt thou call on Tyr.\n\n7. Ale-runes learn, that with lies the wife\nOf another betray not thy trust;\nOn the horn thou shalt write, and the backs of thy hands,\nAnd Need shalt mark on thy nails.\nThou shalt bless the draught, and danger escape,\nAnd cast a leek in the cup;\n(For so I know thou never shalt see\nThy mead with evil mixed.)\n\n8. Birth-runes learn, if help thou wilt lend,\nThe babe from the mother to bring;\nOn thy palms shalt write them, and round thy joints,\nAnd ask the fates to aid.\n\n9. Wave-runes learn, if well thou wouldst shelter\nThe sail-steeds out on the sea;\nOn the stem shalt thou write, and the steering blade,\nAnd burn them into the oars;\nThough high be the breakers, and black the waves,\nThou shalt safe the harbor seek.\n\n10. Branch-runes learn, if a healer wouldst be,\nAnd cure for wounds wouldst work;\nOn the bark shalt thou write, and on trees that be\nWith boughs to the eastward bent.\n\n11. Speech-runes learn, that none may seek\nTo answer harm with hate;\nWell he winds and weaves them all,\nAnd sets them side by side,\nAt the judgment-place, when justice there\nThe folk shall fairly win.\n\n12. Thought-runes learn, if all shall think\nThou art keenest minded of men.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n13. Them Hropt arranged, and them he wrote,\nAnd them in thought he made,\nOut of the draught that down had dropped\nFrom the head of Heithdraupnir,\nAnd the horn of Hoddrofnir.\n\n14. On the mountain he stood with Brimir's sword,\nOn his head the helm he bore;\nThen first the head of Mim spoke forth,\nAnd words of truth it told.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n15. He bade write on the shield before the shining goddess,\nOn Arvak's ear, and on Alsvith's hoof,\nOn the wheel of the car of Hrungnir's killer,\nOn Sleipnir's teeth, and the straps of the sledge.\n\n16. On the paws of the bear, and on Bragi's tongue,\nOn the wolf's claws bared, and the eagle's beak,\nOn bloody wings, and bridge's end,\nOn freeing hands and helping foot-prints.\n\n17. On glass and on gold, and on goodly charms,\nIn wine and in beer, and on well-loved seats,\nOn Gungnir's point, and on Grani's breast,\nOn the nails of Norns, and the night-owl's beak.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n18. Shaved off were the runes that of old were written,\nAnd mixed with the holy mead,\nAnd sent on ways so wide;\nSo the gods had them, so the elves got them,\nAnd some for the Wanes so wise,\nAnd some for mortal men.\n\n19. Beech-runes are there, birth-runes are there,\nAnd all the runes of ale,\nAnd the magic runes of might;\nWho knows them rightly and reads them true,\nHas them himself to help;\nEver they aid,\nTill the gods are gone.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n<i>Brynhild spake:</i>\n20. \"Now shalt thou choose, for the choice is given,\nThou tree of the biting blade;\nSpeech or silence, 'tis thine to say,\nOur evil is destined all.\"\n\n<i>Sigurth spake:</i>\n21. \"I shall not flee, though my fate be near,\nI was born not a coward to be;\nThy loving word for mine will I win,\nAs long as I shall live.\"\n\n22. Then first I rede thee, that free of guilt\nToward kinsmen ever thou art;\nNo vengeance have, though they work thee harm,\nReward after death thou shalt win.\n\n23. Then second I rede thee, to swear no oath\nIf true thou knowest it not;\nBitter the fate of the breaker of troth,\nAnd poor is the wolf of his word.\n\n24. Then third I rede thee, that thou at the Thing\nShalt fight not in words with fools;\nFor the man unwise a worser word\nThan he thinks doth utter oft.\n\n25. Ill it is if silent thou art,\nA coward born men call thee,\nAnd truth mayhap they tell;\nSeldom safe is fame,\nUnless wide renown be won;\nOn the day thereafter send him to death,\nLet him pay the price of his lies.\n\n26. Then fourth I rede thee, if thou shalt find\nA wily witch on thy road,\nIt is better to go than her guest to be,\nThough night enfold thee fast.\n\n27. Eyes that see need the sons of men\nWho fight in battle fierce;\nOft witches evil sit by the way,\nWho blade and courage blunt.\n\n28. Then fifth I rede thee, though maidens fair\nThou seest on benches sitting,\nLet the silver of kinship not rob thee of sleep,\nAnd the kissing of women beware.\n\n29. Then sixth I rede thee, if men shall wrangle,\nAnd ale-talk rise to wrath,\nNo words with a drunken warrior have,\nFor wine steals many men's wits.\n\n30. Brawls and ale full oft have been\nAn ill to many a man,\nDeath for some, and sorrow for some;\nFull many the woes of men.\n\n31. Then seventh I rede thee, if battle thou seekest\nWith a foe that is full of might;\nIt is better to fight than to burn alive\nIn the hall of the hero rich.\n\n32. Then eighth I rede thee, that evil thou shun,\nAnd beware of lying words;\nTake not a maid, nor the wife of a man,\nNor lure them on to lust.\n\n33. Then ninth I rede thee: burial render\nIf thou findest a fallen corpse,\nOf sickness dead, or dead in the sea,\nOr dead of weapons' wounds.\n\n34. A bath shalt thou give them who corpses be,\nAnd hands and head shalt wash;\nWipe them and comb, ere they go in the coffin,\nAnd pray that they sleep in peace.\n\n35. Then tenth I rede thee, that never thou trust\nThe word of the race of wolves,\n(If his brother thou broughtest to death,\nOr his father thou didst fell;)\nOften a wolf in a son there is,\nThough gold he gladly takes.\n\n36. Battle and hate and harm, methinks,\nFull seldom fall asleep;\nWits and weapons the warrior needs\nIf boldest of men he would be.\n\n37. Then eleventh I rede thee, that wrath thou shun,\nAnd treachery false with thy friends;\nNot long the leader's life shall be,\nFor great are the foes he faces."
