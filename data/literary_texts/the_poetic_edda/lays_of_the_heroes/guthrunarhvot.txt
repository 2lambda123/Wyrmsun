	text = "~<Guthrun's Inciting~>\n\nGuthrun went forth to the sea after she had slain Atli. She went out into the sea and fain would drown herself, but she could not sink. The waves bore her across the fjord to the land of King Jonak; he took her as wife; their sons were Sorli and Erp and Hamther. There was brought up Svanhild, Sigurth's daughter; she was married to the mighty Jormunrek. With him was Bikki, who counselled that Randver, the king's son, should have her. This Bikki told to the king. The king had Randver hanged, and Svanhild trodden to death under horses' feet. And when Guthrun learned this, she spake with her sons.\n\n1. A word-strife I learned, most woeful of all,\nA speech from the fullness of sorrow spoken,\nWhen fierce of heart her sons to the fight\nDid Guthrun whet with words full grim.\n\n2. \"Why sit ye idle, why sleep out your lives,\nWhy grieve ye not in gladness to speak?\nSince Jormunrek your sister young\nBeneath the hoofs of horses hath trodden,\n(White and black on the battle-way,\nGray, road-wonted, the steeds of the Goths.)\n\n3. \"Not like are ye to Gunnar of yore,\nNor have ye hearts such as Hogni's was;\nVengeance for her ye soon would have\nIf brave ye were as my brothers of old,\nOr hard your hearts as the Hunnish kings'.\"\n\n4. Then Hamther spake, the high of heart:\n\"Little the deed of Hogni didst love,\nWhen Sigurth they wakened from his sleep;\nThy bed-covers white were red with blood\nOf thy husband, drenched with gore from his heart.\n\n5. \"Bloody revenge didst have for thy brothers,\nEvil and sore, when thy sons didst slay;\nElse yet might we all on Jormunrek\nTogether our sister's slaying avenge.\n\n6. . . . . .  . . . . .\nThe gear of the Hunnish kings now give us!\nThou hast whetted us so to the battle of swords.\"\n\n7. Laughing did Guthrun go to her chamber,\nThe helms of the kings from the cupboards she took,\nAnd mail-coats broad, to her sons she bore them;\nOn their horses' backs the heroes leaped.\n\n8. Then Hamther spake, the high of heart:\n\"Homeward no more his mother to see\nComes the spear-god, fallen mid Gothic folk;\nOne death-draught thou for us all shalt drink,\nFor Svanhild then and thy sons as well.\"\n\n9. Weeping Guthrun, Gjuki's daughter,\nWent sadly before the gate to sit,\nAnd with tear-stained cheeks to tell the tale\nOf her mighty griefs, so many in kind.\n\n10. \"Three home-fires knew I, three hearths I knew,\nHome was I brought by husbands three;\nBut Sigurth only of all was dear,\nHe whom my brothers brought to his death.\n\n11. \"A greater sorrow I saw not nor knew,\nYet more it seemed I must suffer yet\nWhen the princes great to Atli gave me.\n\n12. \"The brave boys I summoned to secret speech;\nFor my woes requital I might not win\nTill off the heads of the Hniflungs I hewed.\n\n13. \"To the sea I went, my heart full sore\nFor the Norns, whose wrath I would now escape;\nBut the lofty billows bore me undrowned,\nTill to land I came, so I longer must live.\n\n14. \"Then to the bed-- of old was it better!--\nOf a king of the folk a third time I came;\nBoys I bore his heirs to be,\nHeirs so young, the sons of Jonak.\n\n15. \"But round Svanhild handmaidens sat,\nShe was dearest ever of all my children;\nSo did Svanhild seem in my hall\nAs the ray of the sun is fair to see.\n\n16. \"Gold I gave her and garments bright,\nEre I let her go to the Gothic folk;\nOf my heavy woes the hardest it was\nWhen Svanhild's tresses fair were trodden\nIn the mire by hoofs of horses wild.\n\n17. \"The sorest it was when Sigurth mine\nOn his couch, of victory robbed, they killed;\nAnd grimmest of all when to Gunnar's heart\nThere crept the bright-hued crawling snakes.\n\n18. \"And keenest of all when they cut the heart\nFrom the living breast of the king so brave;\nMany woes I remember,  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n19. \"Bridle, Sigurth, thy steed so black,\nHither let run thy swift-faring horse;\nHere there sits not son or daughter\nWho yet to Guthrun gifts shall give.\n\n20. \"Remember, Sigurth, what once we said,\nWhen together both on the bed we sat,\nThat mightily thou to me wouldst come\nFrom hell and I from earth to thee.\n\n21. \"Pile ye up, jarls, the pyre of oak,\nMake it the highest a hero e'er had;\nLet the fire burn my grief-filled breast,\nMy sore-pressed heart, till my sorrows melt.\"\n\n22. May nobles all less sorrow know,\nAnd less the woes of women become,\nSince the tale of this lament is told."
