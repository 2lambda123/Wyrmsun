	text = "~<The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane~>\n\n1. In olden days, when eagles screamed,\nAnd holy streams from heaven's crags fell,\nWas Helgi then, the hero-hearted,\nBorghild's son, in Bralund born.\n\n2. 'Twas night in the dwelling, and Norns there came,\nWho shaped the life of the lofty one;\nThey bade him most famed of fighters all\nAnd best of princes ever to be.\n\n3. Mightily wove they the web of fate,\nWhile Bralund's towns were trembling all;\nAnd there the golden threads they wove,\nAnd in the moon's hall fast they made them.\n\n4. East and west the ends they hid,\nIn the middle the hero should have his land;\nAnd Neri's kinswoman northward cast\nA chain, and bade it firm ever to be.\n\n5. Once sorrow had the Ylfings' son,\nAnd grief the bride who the loved one had borne.\n\n<i>* * * * * *</i>\n\nQuoth raven to raven, on treetop resting,\nSeeking for food, \"There is something I know.\n\n6. \"In mail-coat stands the son of Sigmund,\nA half-day old; now day is here;\nHis eyes flash sharp as the heroes' are,\nHe is friend of the wolves; full glad are we.\"\n\n7. The warrior throng a ruler thought him,\nGood times, they said, mankind should see;\nThe king himself from battle-press came,\nTo give the prince a leek full proud.\n\n8. Helgi he named him, and Hringstathir gave him,\nSolfjoll, Snæfjoll, and Sigarsvoll,\nHringstoth, Hotun, and Himinvangar,\nAnd a blood-snake bedecked to Sinfjotli's brother.\n\n9. Mighty he grew in the midst of his friends,\nThe fair-born elm, in fortune's glow;\nTo his comrades gold he gladly gave,\nThe hero spared not the blood-flecked hoard.\n\n10. Short time for war the chieftain waited,\nWhen fifteen winters old he was;\nHunding he slew, the hardy wight\nWho long had ruled o'er lands and men.\n\n11. Of Sigmund's son then next they sought\nHoard and rings, the sons of Hunding;\nThey bade the prince requital pay\nFor booty stolen and father slain.\n\n12. The prince let not their prayers avail,\nNor gold for their dead did the kinsmen get;\nWaiting, he said, was a mighty storm\nOf lances gray and Othin's grimness.\n\n13. The warriors forth to the battle went,\nThe field they chose at Logafjoll;\nFrothi's peace midst foes they broke,\nThrough the isle went hungrily Vithrir's hounds.\n\n14. The king then sat, when he had slain\nEyjolf and Alf, 'neath the eagle-stone;\nHjorvarth and Hovarth, Hunding's sons,\nThe kin of the spear-wielder, all had he killed.\n\n15. Then glittered light from Logafjoll,\nAnd from the light the flashes leaped;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n16. . . . . . . . . . .\nHigh under helms on heaven's field;\nTheir byrnies all with blood were red,\nAnd from their spears the sparks flew forth.\n\n17. Early then in wolf-wood asked\nThe mighty king of the southern maid,\nIf with the hero home would she\nCome that night; the weapons clashed.\n\n18. Down from her horse sprang Hogni's daughter,--\nThe shields were still,-- and spake to the hero:\n\"Other tasks are ours, methinks,\nThan drinking beer with the breaker of rings.\n\n19. \"My father has pledged his daughter fair\nAs bride to Granmar's son so grim;\nBut, Helgi, I once Hothbrodd called\nAs fine a king as the son of a cat.\n\n20. \"Yet the hero will come a few nights hence,\n. . . . . . . . . .\nUnless thou dost bid him the battle-ground seek,\nOr takest the maid from the warrior mighty.\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n21. \"Fear him not, though Isung he felled,\nFirst must our courage keen be tried,\nBefore unwilling thou fare with the knave;\nWeapons will clash, if to death I come not.\"\n\n22. Messengers sent the mighty one then,\nBy land and by sea, a host to seek,\nStore of wealth of the water's gleam,\nAnd men to summon, and sons of men.\n\n23. \"Bid them straightway seek the ships,\nAnd off Brandey ready to be!\"\nThere the chief waited till thither were come\nMen by hundreds from Hethinsey.\n\n24. Soon off Stafnsnes stood the ships,\nFair they glided and gay with gold;\nThen Helgi spake to Hjorleif asking:\n\"Hast thou counted the gallant host?\"\n\n25. The young king answered the other then:\n\"Long were it to tell from Tronueyr\nThe long-stemmed ships with warriors laden\nThat come from without into Orvasund.\n\n26. . . . . . . . . . .\n\"There are hundreds twelve of trusty men,\nBut in Hotun lies the host of the king,\nGreater by half; I have hope of battle.\"\n\n27. The ship's-tents soon the chieftain struck,\nAnd waked the throng of warriors all;\n(The heroes the red of dawn beheld;)\nAnd on the masts the gallant men\nMade fast the sails in Varinsfjord.\n\n28. There was beat of oars and clash of iron,\nShield smote shield as the ships'-folk rowed;\nSwiftly went the warrior-laden\nFleet of the ruler forth from the land.\n\n29. So did it sound, when together the sisters\nOf Kolga struck with the keels full long,\nAs if cliffs were broken with beating surf,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n30. Helgi bade higher hoist the sails,\nNor did the ships'-folk shun the waves,\nThough dreadfully did Ægir's daughters\nSeek the steeds of the sea to sink.\n\n31. But from above did Sigrun brave\nAid the men and all their faring;\nMightily came from the claws of Ron\nThe leader's sea-beast off Gnipalund.\n\n32. At evening there in Unavagar\nFloated the fleet bedecked full fair;\nBut they who saw from Svarin's hill,\nBitter at heart the host beheld.\n\n33. Then Gothmund asked, goodly of birth,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\"Who is the monarch who guides the host,\nAnd to the land the warriors leads?\"\n\n34. Sinfjotli answered, and up on an oar\nRaised a shield all red with golden rim;\nA sea-sentry was he, skilled to speak,\nAnd in words with princes well to strive.\n\n35. \"Say tonight when you feed the swine,\nAnd send your bitches to seek their swill,\nThat out of the East have the Ylfings come,\nGreedy for battle, to Gnipalund.\n\n36. \"There will Hothbrodd Helgi find,\nIn the midst of the fleet, and flight he scorns;\nOften has he the eagles gorged,\nWhilst thou at the quern wert slave-girls kissing.\"\n\n<i>Gothmund spake:</i>\n37. \"Hero, the ancient sayings heed,\nAnd bring not lies to the nobly born.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n38. \"Thou hast eaten the entrails of wolves,\nAnd of thy brothers the slayer been;\nOft wounds to suck thy cold mouth sought,\nAnd loathed in rocky dens didst lurk.\"\n\n<i>Sinfjotli spake:</i>\n39. \"A witch in Varin's isle thou wast,\nA woman false, and lies didst fashion;\nOf the mail-clad heroes thou wouldst have\nNo other, thou saidst, save Sinfjotli only.\n\n40. \"A Valkyrie wast thou, loathly Witch,\nEvil and base, in Allfather's home;\nThe warriors all must ever fight,\nWoman subtle, for sake of thee.\n\n41. \". . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\nNine did we in Sogunes\nOf wolf-cubs have; I their father was.\"\n\n<i>Gothmund spake:</i>\n42. \"Thou didst not father Fenrir's-wolves,\nThough older thou art than all I know;\nFor they gelded thee in Gnipalund,\nThe giant-women at Thorsnes once.\n\n43. \"Under houses the stepson of Siggeir lay,\nFain of the wolf's cry out in the woods;\nEvil came then all to thy hands,\nWhen thy brothers' breasts thou didst redden,\nFame didst thou win for foulest deeds.\n\n44. \"In Bravoll wast thou Grani's bride,\nGolden-bitted and ready to gallop;\nI rode thee many a mile, and down\nDidst sink, thou giantess, under the saddle.\"\n\n<i>Sinfjotli spake:</i>\n45. \"A brainless fellow didst seem to be,\nWhen once for Gollnir goats didst milk,\nAnd another time when as Imth's daughter\nIn rags thou wentest; wilt longer wrangle?\"\n\n<i>Gothmund spake:</i>\n46. \"Sooner would I at Frekastein\nFeed the ravens with flesh of thine\nThan send your bitches to seek their swill,\nOr feed the swine; may the fiends take you!\"\n\n<i>Helgi spake:</i>\n47. \"Better, Sinfjotli, thee 'twould beseem\nBattle to give and eagles to gladden,\nThan vain and empty words to utter,\nThough ring-breakers oft in speech do wrangle.\n\n48. \"Good I find not the sons of Granmar,\nBut for heroes 'tis seemly the truth to speak;\nAt Moinsheimar proved the men\nThat hearts for the wielding of swords they had.\"\n\n49. Mightily then they made to run\nSviputh and Sveggjuth to Solheimar;\n(By dewy dales and chasms dark,\nMist's horse shook where the men went by;)\nThe king they found at his courtyard gate,\nAnd told him the foeman fierce was come.\n\n50. Forth stood Hothbrodd, helmed for battle,\nWatched the riding of his warriors;\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\"Why are the Hniflungs white with fear?\"\n\n<i>Gothmund spake:</i>\n51. \"Swift keels lie hard by the land,\n(Mast-ring harts and mighty yards,\nWealth of shields and well-planed oars;)\nThe king's fair host, the Ylfings haughty;\nFifteen bands to land have fared,\nBut out in Sogn are seven thousand.\n\n52. \"At anchor lying off Gnipalund\nAre fire-beasts black, all fitted with gold;\nThere wait most of the foeman's men,\nNor will Helgi long the battle delay.\"\n\n<i>Hothbrodd spake:</i>\n53. \"Bid the horses run to the Reginthing,\nMelnir and Mylnir to Myrkwood now,\n(And Sporvitnir to Sparinsheith;)\nLet no man seek henceforth to sit\nWho the flame of wounds knows well to wield.\n\n54. \"Summon Hogni, the sons of Hring,\nAtli and Yngvi and Alf the Old;\nGlad they are of battle ever;\nAgainst the Volsungs let us go.\"\n\n55. Swift as a storm there smote together\nThe flashing blades at Frekastein;\nEver was Helgi, Hunding's slayer,\nFirst in the throng where warriors fought;\n(Fierce in battle, slow to fly,\nHard the heart of the hero was.)\n\n56. From heaven there came the maidens helmed,--\nThe weapon-clang grew,-- who watched o'er the king;\nSpake Sigrun fair,-- the wound-givers flew,\nAnd the horse of the giantess raven's-food had:--\n\n57. \"Hail to thee, hero! full happy with men,\nOffspring of Yngvi, shalt ever live,\nFor thou the fearless foe hast slain\nWho to many the dread of death had brought.\n\n58. \"Warrior, well for thyself hast won\nRed rings bright and the noble bride;\nBoth now, warrior, thine shall be,\nHogni's daughter and Hringstathir,\nWealth and triumph; the battle wanes.\""
