	text = "~<The Greenland Lay of Atli~>\n\nGuthrun, Gjuki's daughter, avenged her brothers, as has become well known. She slew first Atli's sons, and thereafter she slew Atli, and burned the hall with his whole company. Concerning this was the following poem made:\n\n1. Atli sent of old to Gunnar\nA keen-witted rider, Knefröth did men call him;\nTo Gjuki's home came he and to Gunnar's dwelling,\nWith benches round the hearth, and to the beer so sweet.\n\n2. Then the followers, hiding their falseness, all drank\nTheir wine in the war-hall, of the Huns' wrath wary;\nAnd Knefröth spake loudly, his words were crafty,\nThe hero from the south, on the high bench sitting:\n\n3. \"Now Atli has sent me his errand to ride,\nOn my bit-champing steed through Myrkwood the secret,\nTo bid You, Gunnar, to his benches to come,\nWith helms round the hearth, and Atli's home seek.\n\n4. \"Shields shall ye choose there, and shafts made of ash-wood,\nGold-adorned helmets, and slaves out of Hunland,\nSilver-gilt saddle-cloths, shirts of bright scarlet,\nWith lances and spears too, and bit-champing steeds.\n\n5. \"The field shall be given you of wide Gnitaheith,\nWith loud-ringing lances, and stems gold-o'er-laid,\nTreasures full huge, and the home of Danp,\nAnd the mighty forest that Myrkwood is called.\"\n\n6. His head turned Gunnar, and to Hogni he said:\n\"What thy counsel, young hero, when such things we hear?\nNo gold do I know on Gnitaheith lying\nSo fair that other its equal we have not.\n\n7. \"We have seven halls, each of swords is full,\n(And all of gold is the hilt of each;)\nMy steed is the swiftest, my sword is sharpest,\nMy bows adorn benches, my byrnies are golden,\nMy helm is the brightest that came from Kjar's hall,\n(Mine own is better than all the Huns' treasure.)\"\n\n<i>Hogni spake:</i>\n8. \"What seeks she to say, that she sends us a ring,\nWoven with a wolf's hair? methinks it gives warning;\nIn the red ring a hair of the heath-dweller found I,\nWolf-like shall our road be if we ride on this journey.\"\n\n9. Not eager were his comrades, nor the men of his kin,\nThe wise nor the wary, nor the warriors bold.\nBut Gunnar spake forth as befitted a king,\nNoble in the beer-hall, and bitter his scorn:\n\n10. \"Stand forth now, Fjornir! and hither on the floor\nThe beakers all golden shalt thou bring to the warriors.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n11. \"The wolves then shall rule the wealth of the Niflungs,\nWolves aged and grey-hued, if Gunnar is lost,\nAnd black-coated bears with rending teeth bite,\nAnd make glad the dogs, if Gunnar returns not.\"\n\n12. A following gallant fared forth with the ruler,\nYet they wept as their home with the hero they left;\nAnd the little heir of Hogni called loudly:\n\"Go safe now, ye wise ones, wherever ye will!\"\n\n13. Then let the bold heroes their bit-champing horses\nOn the mountains gallop, and through Myrkwood the secret;\nAll Hunland was shaken where the hard-souled ones rode,\nOn the whip-fearers fared they through fields that were green.\n\n14. Then they saw Atli's halls, and his watch-towers high,\nOn the walls so lofty stood the warriors of Buthli;\nThe hall of the southrons with seats was surrounded,\nWith targets bound and shields full bright.\n\n15. Mid weapons and lances did Atli his wine\nIn the war-hall drink, without were his watchmen,\nFor Gunnar they waited, if forth he should go,\nWith their ringing spears they would fight with the ruler.\n\n16. This their sister saw, as soon as her brothers\nHad entered the hall,-- little ale had she drunk:\n\"Betrayed art thou, Gunnar! what guard hast thou, hero,\n'Gainst the plots of the Huns? from the hall flee swiftly!\n\n17. \"Brother, 'twere far better to have come in byrnie,\nWith thy household helmed, to see Atli's home,\nAnd to sit in the saddle all day 'neath the sun,\n(That the sword-norns might weep for the death-pale warriors,\nAnd the Hunnish shield-maids might shun not the sword,)\nAnd send Atli himself to the den of the snakes;\n(Now the den of the snakes for thee is destined.\n\n<i>Gunnar spake:</i>\n18. . . . . .  . . . . .\n\"Too late is it, sister, to summon the Niflungs,\nLong is it to come to the throng of our comrades,\nThe heroes gallant, from the hills of the Rhine.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n19. Then Gunnar they seized, and they set him in chains,\nThe Burgundians' king, and fast they bound him.\n\n20. Hogni slew seven with sword so keen,\nAnd an eighth he flung in the fire hot;\nA hero should fight with his foemen thus,\nAs Hogni strove in Gunnar's behalf.\n\n21. . . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nThe leader they asked if his life he fain\nWith gold would buy, the king of the Goths.\n\n<i>Gunnar spake:</i>\n22. \"First the heart of Hogni shall ye lay in my hands,\nAll bloody from the breast of the bold one cut\nWith ke-en-biting sword, from the son of the king.\"\n\n23. . . . . .  . . . . .\nThey cut out the heart from the breast of Hjalli,\nOn a platter they bore it, and brought it to Gunnar.\n\n24. Then Gunnar spake forth, the lord of the folk:\n\"Here have I the heart of Hjalli the craven,\nUnlike to the heart of Hogni the valiant,\nFor it trembles still as it stands on the platter;\nTwice more did it tremble in the breast of the man.\n\n25. Then Hogni laughed when they cut out the heart\nOf the living helm-hammerer; tears he had not.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nOn a platter they bore it, and brought it to Gunnar.\n\n26. Then Gunnar spake forth, the spear of the Niflungs:\n\"Here have I the heart of Hogni the valiant,\nUnlike to the heart of Hjalli the craven,\nLittle it trembles as it lies on the platter,\nStill less did it tremble when it lay in his breast.\n\n27. \"So distant, Atli, from all men's eyes,\nShalt thou be as thou . . . . . from the gold.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n28. \"To no one save me is the secret known\nOf the Niflungs' hoard, now Hogni is dead;\nOf old there were two, while we twain were alive,\nNow is none but I, for I only am living.\n\n29. \"The swift Rhine shall hold the strife-gold of heroes,\nThat once was the gods', the wealth of the Niflungs,\nIn the depths of the waters the death-rings shall glitter,\nAnd not shine on the hands of the Hunnish men.\"\n\n<i>Atli spake:</i>\n30. \"Ye shall bring the wagon, for now is he bound.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n31. On the long-maned Glaum rode Atli the great,\nAbout him were warriors  . . . . .\nBut Guthrun, akin to the gods of slaughter,\nYielded not to her tears in the hall of tumult.\n\nGuthrun spake:\n32. \"It shall go with thee, Atli, as with Gunnar thou heldest\nThe oaths ofttimes sworn, and of old made firm,\nBy the sun in the south, by Sigtyr's mountain,\nBy the horse of the rest-bed, and the ring of Ull.\"\n\n33. Then the champer of bits drew the chieftain great,\nThe gold-guarder, down to the place of death.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n34. By the warriors' host was the living hero\nCast in the den where crawling about\nWithin were serpents, but soon did Gunnar\nWith his hand in wrath on the harp-strings smite;\nThe strings resounded,-- so shall a hero,\nA ring-breaker, gold from his enemies guard.\n\n35. Then Atli rode on his earth-treading steed,\nSeeking his home, from the slaughter-place;\nThere was clatter of hoofs of the steeds in the court,\nAnd the clashing of arms as they came from the field.\n\n36. Out then came Guthrun to meeting with Atli,\nWith a golden beaker as gift to the monarch:\n\"Thou mayst eat now, chieftain, within thy dwelling,\nBlithely with Guthrun young beasts fresh slaughtered.\"\n\n37. The wine-heavy ale-cups of Atli resounded,\nWhen there in the hall the Hunnish youths clamored,\nAnd the warriors bearded, the brave ones, entered.\n\n38. Then in came the shining one,  . . . . .\n . . . . . and drink she bore them;\nUnwilling and bitter brought she food to the warrior,\nTill in scorn to the white-faced Atli did she speak:\n\n39. \"Thou giver of swords, of thy sons the hearts\nAll heavy with blood in honey thou hast eaten;\nThou shalt stomach, thou hero, the flesh of the slain,\nTo eat at thy feast, and to send to thy followers.\n\n40. \"Thou shalt never call to thy knees again\nErp or Eitil, when merry with ale;\nThou shalt never see in their seats again\nThe sharers of gold their lances shaping,\n(Clipping the manes or minding their steeds.)\"\n\n41. There was clamor on the benches, and the cry of men,\nThe clashing of weapons, and weeping of the Huns,\nSave for Guthrun only, she wept not ever\nFor her bear-fierce brothers, or the boys so dear,\nSo young and so unhappy, whom with Atli she had.\n\n42. Gold did she scatter, the swan-white one,\nAnd rings of red gold to the followers gave she;\nThe fate she let grow, and the shining wealth go,\nNor spared she the treasure of the temple itself.\n\n43. Unwise then was Atli, he had drunk to wildness,\nNo weapon did he have, and of Guthrun bewared not;\nOft their play was better when both in gladness\nEach other embraced among princes all.\n\n44. With her sword she gave blood for the bed to drink,\nWith her death-dealing hand, and the hounds she loosed,\nThe thralls she awakened, and a firebrand threw\nIn the door of the hall; so vengeance she had.\n\n45. To the flames she gave all who yet were within,\nAnd from Myrkheim had come from the murder of Gunnar;\nThe timbers old fell, the temple was in flames,\nThe dwelling of the Buthlungs, and the shield-maids burned,\nThey were slain in the house, in the hot flames they sank.\n\n46. Now the tale is all told, nor in later time\nWill a woman in byrnie avenge so her brothers;\nThe fair one to three of the kings of the folk\nBrought the doom of death ere herself she died.\n\nStill more is told in the Greenland ballad of Atli."
